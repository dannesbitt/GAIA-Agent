When Arjan Dwarshuis first heard of the “Big Year”—the legendary record for birdwatching—he was twenty years old, it was midnight, and he was sitting on the roof of a truck in the Andean Mountains. In that moment he promised himself that, someday, somehow, he would become a world-record-holding birder. Ten years later, he embarked on an incredible, arduous, and perilous journey that took him around the globe; over uninhabited islands, through dense unforgiving rainforests, across snowy mountain peaks and unrelenting deserts—in just a single year. Would he survive? Would he be able to break the “Big Year” record, navigating through a world filled with shifting climate and geopolitical challenges? The (Big) Year that Flew By is an unforgettable, personal exploration of the limits of human potential when engaging with the natural world. It is a book about birds and birding and Arjan’s attempts to raise awareness for critically endangered species, but it is also a book about overcoming mental challenges, extreme physical danger, and human competition and fully realizing your passions through nature, adventure, and conservation. “Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.” ― Booklist “I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” —The Washington Post Reviews and Praise “Dutch birders take their pursuit to a higher plane of skill and intensity, as exemplified in this global trek by Arjan Dwarshuis. A fast-paced page-turner and a unique adventure story, The (Big) Year that Flew By is also filled with insights about landscapes, people, and a world of wonderful birds.” —Kenn Kaufman, author of Kingbird Highway More Reviews and Praise “Arjan artistically weaves together the beauty of the birds, the importance of conservation, and the complex logistics of non-stop travel. The roller coaster highs of seeing a target bird, paired with the lows of absolute fatigue and exhaustion, are an innate undertone of any birder’s big year.” —Tiffany Kersten, birding guide and continental U.S. Big Year record holder “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is not simply a celebration of a broken record but a global call to action to protect the habitats that birds rely on for survival. A Big Year of birding is a massive undertaking, requiring a Herculean effort to successfully plan and execute. While this quest involves daunting logistics and emotional hurdles, the most notable achievement is distilling so much lived experience into a single book. Arjan has conquered both, beautifully capturing remote wild places and conveying the intensity endured to find and observe nearly three-quarters of the world’s bird species. Arjan’s contagious passion for birds infuses his account of a global avian scavenger hunt like no other.” —Christian Hagenlocher, author of the Falcon Freeway “An astonishing achievement! Arjan Dwarshuis’s year was so big it covered an entire planet. His eagle eyes took in almost 7,000 species of bird and brought into sharp focus their often-fragile existence. Dwarshuis’s heartfelt prose reminds us that many of these species are living on the edge—just a generation or two away from extinction. Yet this is a story of ... [Content truncated]\n",

By Noah Strycker Contributor, Audubon Magazine Published January 01, 2016 December 31, 2015: Tinsukia, India — Aft er a long day of birding, I went looking for owls this evening with Ramit, Binanda, Bidyut, and Pritam at a forest called Soraipong. We were hoping for a Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl but knew the chances were slim. Suddenly, at our second stop, an owl called from the darkness — and it wasn’t an eagle-owl. “Oriental Bay-Owl!” whispered Binanda. The bird called again, a series of loud whistles, and it sounded close. Back on November 15 I encountered my first Oriental Bay-Owl in Borneo, but this species is much scarcer in India. Ramit has probably seen more of them in this country than anyone else, and this was only his fourth sighting. We tiptoed closer. Pritam turned on his flashlight just as the owl landed on a vertical trunk in front of us, its black eyes focused in our direction. I snapped a couple of photos. The owl lingered for a few moments then flew off. “Congratulations,” said Ramit. “That’s incredible! As far as I know, this is the first time a wild Oriental Bay-Owl has ever been photographed in India.” And that was it: The Oriental Bay-Owl, a new photographic record for India, was my very last bird of 2015. What a sweet way to finish the year. From the Cape Petrel just after midnight last New Year's Day to the bay-owl this evening, 2015 has been a wild ride. ******** Yes, it’s come to this: My last daily post on this blog. How did that happen so fast? Officially, my last new bird of 2015 was a group of Silver-breasted Broadbills just before sunset today (I’d already seen the bay-owl in Borneo). The broadbills were No. 6042, which is where the year list will rest. Six thousand plus the meaning of life, the universe, and everything — not bad! Of course, it’s not just about numbers. For me, this bird list represents a goal exceeded, an adventure shared, and a manifesto of sorts. Before saying so long (and thanks for all the birds), a few lingering details remain. I am writing this in the wee hours of January 1 in northeast India with fireworks going off outside, and it’s been an intense day (year…), so will keep this relatively short. To recap: British birders Rut... [Content truncated]\n",

By Noah Strycker Contributor, Audubon Magazine Published January 01, 2016 December 31, 2015: Tinsukia, India — Aft er a long day of birding, I went looking for owls this evening with Ramit, Binanda, Bidyut, and Pritam at a forest called Soraipong. We were hoping for a Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl but knew the chances were slim. Suddenly, at our second stop, an owl called from the darkness — and it wasn’t an eagle-owl. “Oriental Bay-Owl!” whispered Binanda. The bird called again, a series of loud whistles, and it sounded close. Back on November 15 I encountered my first Oriental Bay-Owl in Borneo, but this species is much scarcer in India. Ramit has probably seen more of them in this country than anyone else, and this was only his fourth sighting. We tiptoed closer. Pritam turned on his flashlight just as the owl landed on a vertical trunk in front of us, its black eyes focused in our direction. I snapped a couple of photos. The owl lingered for a few moments then flew off. “Congratulations,” said Ramit. “That’s incredible! As far as I know, this is the first time a wild Oriental Bay-Owl has ever been photographed in India.” And that was it: The Oriental Bay-Owl, a new photographic record for India, was my very last bird of 2015. What a sweet way to finish the year. From the Cape Petrel just after midnight last New Year's Day to the bay-owl this evening, 2015 has been a wild ride. ******** Yes, it’s come to this: My last daily post on this blog. How did that happen so fast? Officially, my last new bird of 2015 was a group of Silver-breasted Broadbills just before sunset today (I’d already seen the bay-owl in Borneo). The broadbills were No. 6042, which is where the year list will rest. Six thousand plus the meaning of life, the universe, and everything — not bad! Of course, it’s not just about numbers. For me, this bird list represents a goal exceeded, an adventure shared, and a manifesto of sorts. Before saying so long (and thanks for all the birds), a few lingering details remain. I am writing this in the wee hours of January 1 in northeast India with fireworks going off outside, and it’s been an intense day (year…), so will keep this relatively short.

I was excited and a bit afraid of the task at hand. I had to find my way across a city with 14 million inhabitants to my hotel, the Capsule Inn. That's right, I was sleeping in a capsule tonight. You see, booking an overnight stay in downtown Tokyo during the holidays can be terribly expensive, unless you are prepared to sleep in a 2 m2 room. Luckily, using the Tokyo public transportation system proved much easier than expected. All metro and train stations are named in English and everything is color-coded, making Tokyo actually the easiest mega-city to get around! I arrived at the Capsule Inn around 9 PM and after a fantastic Japanese dinner I went to bed. Four hours later I was awake again thanks to my jetlag and lying awake in a capsule for four hours is not the best feeling in the world ... At 6:30 the alarm went off and my ordeal was over! I had breakfast and took a metro to Yoyogi Station, where I was met by Chris Cook, my guide for today. Together we walked to Yoyogi Park where we started birding. My two main targets were quickly found, the Varied Tit and Japanese Pygmy-woodpecker. Pale and Dusky Thrushes were feeding on the parks open fields and we found a nice flock of wintering Mandarin Ducks on a small pond. From Yoyogi Station we took the metro to Kasai Rinkai Koen at the other side of Tokyo, which is situated at Tokyo Bay. We found out that we were not the only birders out birding with Christmas. There were literally hundreds of photographers and birders in Kasai Rinkai Park! Great to see that birding is hot and happening in Japan! We did find some great birds here, best of the bunch being the gulls. Kamchatca, Black-tailed, Vega and Slaty-backed Gull were all seen and a real bonus was an adult Saunders's Gull found by Chris. Another unexpected find were two Black-faced Spoonbills. At noon I said goodbye to Chris and finished the day birding till dusk before I took a metro to the airport, where I boarded my flight to Taipei, Taiwan .

When Arjan Dwarshuis first heard of the “Big Year”—the legendary record for birdwatching—he was twenty years old, it was midnight, and he was sitting on the roof of a truck in the Andean Mountains. In that moment he promised himself that, someday, somehow, he would become a world-record-holding birder. Ten years later, he embarked on an incredible, arduous, and perilous journey that took him around the globe; over uninhabited islands, through dense unforgiving rainforests, across snowy mountain peaks and unrelenting deserts—in just a single year. Would he survive? Would he be able to break the “Big Year” record, navigating through a world filled with shifting climate and geopolitical challenges? The (Big) Year that Flew By is an unforgettable, personal exploration of the limits of human potential when engaging with the natural world. It is a book about birds and birding and Arjan’s attempts to raise awareness for critically endangered species, but it is also a book about overcoming mental challenges, extreme physical danger, and human competition and fully realizing your passions through nature, adventure, and conservation. “Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.” ― Booklist “I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” —The Washington Post Reviews and Praise “Dutch birders take their pursuit to a higher plane of skill and intensity, as exemplified in this global trek by Arjan Dwarshuis. A fast-paced page-turner and a unique adventure story, The (Big) Year that Flew By is also filled with insights about landscapes, people, and a world of wonderful birds.” —Kenn Kaufman, author of Kingbird Highway More Reviews and Praise “Arjan artistically weaves together the beauty of the birds, the importance of conservation, and the complex logistics of non-stop travel. The roller coaster highs of seeing a target bird, paired with the lows of absolute fatigue and exhaustion, are an innate undertone of any birder’s big year.” —Tiffany Kersten, birding guide and continental U.S. Big Year record holder “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is not simply a celebration of a broken record but a global call to action to protect the habitats that birds rely on for survival. A Big Year of birding is a massive undertaking, requiring a Herculean effort to successfully plan and execute. While this quest involves daunting logistics and emotional hurdles, the most notable achievement is distilling so much lived experience into a single book. Arjan has conquered both, beautifully capturing remote wild places and conveying the intensity endured to find and observe nearly three-quarters of the world’s bird species. Arjan’s contagious passion for birds infuses his account of a global avian scavenger hunt like no other.” —Christian Hagenlocher, author of the Falcon Freeway “An astonishing achievement! Arjan Dwarshuis’s year was so big it covered an entire planet. His eagle eyes took in almost 7,000 species of bird and brought into sharp focus their often-fragile existence. Dwarshuis’s heartfelt prose reminds us that many of these species are living on the edge—just a generation or two away from extinction. Yet this is a story of ... [Content truncated]\n",
