Mercedes Sosa Portrait by Annemarie Heinrich , 1960s Born Haydée Mercedes Sosa ( 1935-07-09 ) 9 July 1935 San Miguel de Tucumán , Tucumán, Argentina Died 4 October 2009 (2009-10-04) (aged 74) Buenos Aires , Argentina Occupation Singer Years active 1950–2009 Musical career Genres Folk nueva canción Instruments Vocals Musical artist Haydée Mercedes \" La Negra \" Sosa ( Latin American Spanish: [meɾˈseðes ˈsosa] ; 9 July 1935 [ 1 ] – 4 October 2009) was an Argentine singer who was popular throughout Latin America and many countries outside the region. With her roots in Argentine folk music , Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero . She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\". [ 2 ] She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\". [ 3 ] Sosa performed in venues such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, the Théâtre Mogador in Paris, the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, as well as sold-out shows in New York's Carnegie Hall and the Roman Colosseum during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she was the recipient of six Latin Grammy awards (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011), including a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and two posthumous Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2009 and 2011. She won the Premio Gardel in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for UNICEF . Life [ edit ] Sosa was born on 9 July 1935, in San Miguel de Tucumán , in the northwestern Argentine province of Tucumán , of mestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent. [ 4 ] Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage. [ 5 ] Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman, [ 6 ] were Peronists , although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio. [ 7 ] In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months. [ 8 ] She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra , in 1959. [ 8 ] A performance at the 1965 Cosquín National Folklore Festival —where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune — [ 9 ] brought her to the attention of the Argentine public. [ 8 ] Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus , with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canción movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina). [ 10 ] Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento , a collection of Argentine folk songs. Sosa with Félix Luna and Ariel Ramírez (at the piano) Sosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries. [ 11 ] In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success. [ citation needed ] In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America. In the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer Ariel Ramírez and lyricist Félix Luna : Cantata Sudamericana and Mujeres Argentinas (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician Violeta Parra in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa's signature songs, Gracias a la vida . [ 4 ] [ 12 ] She further popularized of songs written by Milton Nascimento of Brazil and Pablo Milanés and Silvio Rodríguez both from Cuba . [ 4 ] Throughout the decade, she released albums such as Hasta la Victoria in 1972 and Traigo un Pueblo en mi Voz in 1973. They featured songs like \"Cuando tenga la tierra\", written by Ariel Petrocelli and Daniel Toro, which tackles political and social issues like wealth and land inequality. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] During the 1970s she was a part of two films by the director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson : El Santo de la Espada in 1970 and Güemes, la tierra en armas in 1971, in which she portrayed Juana Azurduy de Padilla , the guerrilla military leader who fought for Argentine independence. [ 13 ] [ 15 ] Sosa in 1972 After the military junta of Jorge Videla came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive. Sosa faced death threats against both her and her family, but refused for many years to leave the country. At a concert in La Plata in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with all those attending the concert. [ 10 ] Their release came about through international intervention. [ 8 ] Despite attempts to hold more concerts, she was officially barred from performing by the military regime. [ 5 ] Banned in her own country, she moved to Paris and then to Madrid . [ 8 ] [ 10 ] She has spoken publicly about her artistic and emotional struggles during this period of her life. [ 5 ] While in exile, she released the album A Quien Doy in 1981. The album included a recording of the song \"Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pais\" which was originally written by the prolific Chilean singer/songwriter, Patricio Manns . The song, which he wrote while also in political exile, expresses the sorrow he felt from being separated from his homeland. [ 16 ] She related to this feeling and struggled to continue recording and performing. In an interview with the New York Times, she said, “It was a mental problem, a problem of morale...It wasn’t my throat, or anything physical\". [ 5 ] Sosa returned to Argentina from her exile in Europe in February of 1982, [ 17 ] [ 10 ] several months before the military regime collapsed as a result of the Falklands War , and gave a series of concerts at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires, where she invited many of her younger colleagues to share the stage. A double album of recordings from these performances became an instant best seller. She then traveled to perform in her home province of Tucuman. However, these performances were largely ignored by mainstream media in the country. [ 17 ] In subsequent years, Sosa continued to tour both in Argentina and abroad, performing in such venues as the Lincoln Center in New York City and the Théâtre Mogador in Paris. In poor health for much of the 1990s, she performed a comeback show in Argentina in 1998. [ 8 ] In 1994, she played in the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. [ 4 ] In 2002, she sold out both Carnegie Hall in New York and the Colosseum in Rome in the same year. [ 4 ] Sosa in 1973 A supporter of Perón , she favored leftist causes throughout her life. She supported President Raul Alfonsin in the election of 1983 which marked the return of democracy in Argentina following the dictatorship. She referred to this election as \"Argentina's Spring\" [ 18 ] She opposed President Carlos Menem , who was in office from 1989 to 1999, and supported the election of Néstor Kirchner , who became president in 2003. [ 19 ] Sosa was a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Latin America and the Caribbean. [ 10 ] [ 20 ] Sosa disliked being identified as a protest singer. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] While she was outright in her political stances, Sosa said the following on the position of the artist: “An artist isn’t political in the party political sense – they have a constituency, which is their public – it is the poetry that matters most of all.” In a career spanning four decades, she worked with performers across several genres and generations, folk, opera, pop, rock, including Martha Argerich , Andrea Bocelli , David Broza , Franco Battiato , Jaime Roos , Joan Baez , Francis Cabrel , Gal Costa , Luz Casal , Lila Downs , Lucio Dalla , Maria Farantouri , Lucecita Benitez , Nilda Fernández , Charly Garcia , León Gieco , Gian Marco , Nana Mouskouri , Pablo Milanés , Holly Near , Milton Nascimento , Pata Negra , Fito Páez , Franco De Vita , Lourdes Pérez , Luciano Pavarotti , Silvio Rodríguez , Ismael Serrano , Shakira , Sting , Caetano Veloso , [ 4 ] Julieta Venegas , Gustavo Cerati and Konstantin Wecker [ 10 ] Sosa participated in a 1999 production of Ariel Ramírez 's Misa Criolla . [ 23 ] Her song Balderrama is featured in the 2008 movie Che , starring Benicio del Toro as the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara . [ 24 ] Sosa was the co-chair of the Earth Charter International Commission. Awards [ edit ] Sosa won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2000 ( Misa Criolla ), [ 25 ] 2003 ( Acústico ), [ 26 ] 2006 ( Corazón Libre ), [ 27 ] 2009 ( Cantora 1 , which also won Best Recording Package and was nominated for Album of the Year ), [ 28 ] and 2011 ( Deja La Vida Volar ), [ 29 ] as well as several international awards. In 1995, Konex Foundation from Argentina granted her the Diamond Konex Award , one of the most prestigious awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in the popular music of her country in the last decade. [ 30 ] Death [ edit ] Mercedes Sosa lying in repose, with her family and President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner viewing Suffering from recurrent endocrine and respiratory problems in later years, the 74-year-old Sosa was hospitalized in Buenos Aires on 18 September 2009. [ 31 ] She died from multiple organ failure on 4 October 2009, at 5:15 am. [ 12 ] She is survived by one son, Fabián Matus, born of her first marriage. [ 8 ] [ 32 ] He said: \"She lived her 74 years to the fullest. She had done practically everything she wanted, she didn't have any type of barrier or any type of fear that limited her\". [ 32 ] The hospital expressed its sympathies to her relatives. [ 33 ] Her website featured the following: \"Her undisputed talent, her honesty and her profound convictions leave a great legacy to future generations\". [ 34 ] Her body was placed on display at the National Congress building in Buenos Aires for the public to pay their respects, and President Fernández de Kirchner ordered three days of national mourning. [ 32 ] [ 35 ] Thousands had queued by the end of the day. [ 34 ] [ 36 ] Sosa's obituary in The Daily Telegraph said she was \"an unrivalled interpreter of works by her compatriot, the Argentine Atahualpa Yupanqui , and Chile's Violeta Parra \". [ 8 ] Helen Popper of Reuters reported her death by saying she \"fought South America's dictators with her voice and became a giant of contemporary Latin American music\". [ 36 ] Sosa received three Latin Grammy nominations for her album, in 2009 . She went on to win Best Folk Album about a month after her death. [ 4 ] [ 10 ] Tributes [ edit ] In 2019, Sosa was celebrated by a Google Doodle . The doodle was showcased in Argentina , Chile , Uruguay , Paraguay , Bolivia , Peru , Ecuador , Cuba , Iceland , Sweden, Serbia , Greece , Israel and Vietnam . [ 37 ] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Sosa at number 160 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. [ 38 ] Discography [ edit ] Sosa in 2005, with Argentina's then-First Lady (later president from 2007 to 2015), Cristina Fernández de Kirchner Sosa recorded forty albums.

[ 6 ] The album also peaked at numbers 22 and 8 at the Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts in United States, respectively, being Sosa's only appearances on both charts. At documentary film titled Mercedes Sosa, Cantora un viaje íntimo was released on 2009, it was directed by Rodrigo Vila and features the recording process of the album as well as testimonies from the different guest artists that appeared on the project. [ 7 ] Background [ edit ] The albums were produced by Popi Spatocco, frequent collaborator of Sosa, engineered by Jorge \"Portugués\" Da Silva and recorded from May 2008 to June 2009 at Estudios Panda and Estudios Ion, both in Buenos Aires, Argentina , the first session took place at Estudios Panda while the rest of the album was recorded at Estudios Ion, the first songs to be recorded were \"Agua, Fuego, Tierra y Viento\" with Argentine singer Soledad Pastorutti and \"Misionera\" with Brazilian accordionist Luiz Carlos Borges, the recording of the album was marked by interruptions due to the delicate health condition of Sosa, she would eventually die on October 16, 2009 at age 74, a couple of months following the release of the albums, about Cantora , Spatocco said that \"it was like receiving a diploma of honor, she was dedicated to whatever happened because she knew that I had her back\". [ 8 ] Content [ edit ] The album contains a series of duet versions of songs alongside different artists from both Argentina, as well as from other countries such as Mexico, Uruguay, Brazil, Colombia, Spain and Venezuela. [ 9 ] The variety of songs included range from songs performed with their original artist to songs performed with artists different than their original performer, many of the artists featured make reprises of their own songs for the album like Gustavo Cerati in the version of Soda Stereo 's \"Zonas de Promesas\", Charly García in the version of Serú Girán 's \"Desarma y Sangra\" and Luis Alberto Spinetta in the version of his song \"Barro Tal Vez\", while others appear in versions of songs not from their discography, like Shakira , who features in the track \" La Maza \", originally written and performed by Silvio Rodríguez , and Vicentico who appears the version of Ruben Blades 's \"Parao\". [ 10 ] The albums end with a version of the Argentine National Anthem , being the only song in the albums to not feature a particular singer. [ 11 ] Critical reception [ edit ] Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic (Vol. 1) [ 12 ] AllMusic (Vol. 2) [ 13 ] Mariano Prunes from AllMusic gave both volumes of the album three and a half stars out of five. In his review for Cantora 1 he wrote that \"contrary to the quintessential Sosa recordings, Cantora is a fairly subdued affair, with most songs whispered against unobtrusive yet tasteful acoustic arrangements by Poppi Spatocco\", also commenting that the production \"certainly works very well, as it creates an encompassing sonic texture that helps to render the entire album less dissimilar than it may have been\". [ 12 ] In the review for Cantora 2 he wrote that both albums as a whole are \"a touching, dignified conclusion to a musical legacy that is as enormous as it is precious\" while also calling \"Canción Para un Niño de la Calle\", the collaboration with Puerto Rican rapper Residente , as \"the highlight of the entire project\". [ 13 ] In 2009, the Argentine edition of Rolling Stone included the album on their list of \"50 Best Albums of 2009\", placing it at number 2 calling it \"a true artistic testament\".

Mercedes Sosa Portrait by Annemarie Heinrich , 1960s Born Haydée Mercedes Sosa ( 1935-07-09 ) 9 July 1935 San Miguel de Tucumán , Tucumán, Argentina Died 4 October 2009 (2009-10-04) (aged\\xa074) Buenos Aires , Argentina Occupation Singer Years\\xa0active 1950–2009 Musical career Genres Folk nueva canción Instruments Vocals Musical artist Haydée Mercedes \" La Negra \" Sosa ( Latin American Spanish: [meɾˈseðes ˈsosa] ; 9 July 1935 [ 1 ] – 4 October 2009) was an Argentine singer who was popular throughout Latin America and many countries outside the region. With her roots in Argentine folk music , Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero . She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\". [ 2 ] She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\". [ 3 ] Sosa performed in venues such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, the Théâtre Mogador in Paris, the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, as well as sold-out shows in New York\\'s Carnegie Hall and the Roman Colosseum during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she was the recipient of six Latin Grammy awards (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011), including a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and two posthumous Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2009 and 2011. She won the Premio Gardel in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for UNICEF . Life [ edit ] Sosa was born on 9 July 1935, in San Miguel de Tucumán , in the northwestern Argentine province of Tucumán , of mestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent. [ 4 ] Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage. [ 5 ] Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman, [ 6 ] were Peronists , although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio. [ 7 ] In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months. [ 8 ] She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra , in 1959. [ 8 ] A performance at the 1965 Cosquín National Folklore Festival —where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune — [ 9 ] brought her to the attention of the Argentine public. [ 8 ] Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus , with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canción movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina). [ 10 ] Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento , a collection of Argentine folk songs. Sosa with Félix Luna and Ariel Ramírez (at the piano) Sosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries. [ 11 ] In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success. [ citation needed ] In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America. In the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer Ariel Ramírez and lyricist Félix Luna : Cantata Sudamericana and Mujeres Argentinas (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician Violeta Parra in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa\\'s signature songs, Gracias a la vida . [ 4 ] [ 12 ] She further popularized of songs written by Milton Nascimento of Brazil and Pablo Milanés and Silvio Rodríguez both from Cuba . [ 4 ] Throughout the decade, she released albums such as Hasta la Victoria in 1972 and Traigo un Pueblo en mi Voz in 1973. They featured songs like \"Cuando tenga la tierra\", written by Ariel Petrocelli and Daniel Toro, which tackles political and social issues like wealth and land inequality. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] During the 1970s she was a part of two films by the director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson : El Santo de la Espada in 1970 and Güemes, la tierra en armas in 1971, in which she portrayed Juana Azurduy de Padilla , the guerrilla military leader who fought for Argentine independence. [ 13 ] [ 15 ] Sosa in 1972 After the military junta of Jorge Videla came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive. Sosa faced death threats against both her and her family, but refused for many years to leave the country. At a concert in La Plata in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with all those attending the concert. [ 10 ] Their release came about through international intervention. [ 8 ] Despite attempts to hold more concerts, she was officially barred from performing by the military regime. [ 5 ] Banned in her own country, she moved to Paris and then to Madrid . [ 8 ] [ 10 ] She has spoken publicly about her artistic and emotional struggles during this period of her life. [ 5 ] While in exile, she released the album A Quien Doy in 1981. The album included a recording of the song \"Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pais\" which was originally written by the prolific Chilean singer/songwriter, Patricio Manns . The song, which he wrote while also in political exile, expresses the sorrow he felt from being separated from his homeland. [ 16 ] She related to this feeling and struggled to continue recording and performing. In an interview with the New York Times, she said, “It was a mental problem, a problem of morale...It wasn’t my throat, or anything physical\". [ 5 ] Sosa returned to Argentina from her exile in Europe in February of 1982, [ 17 ] [ 10 ] several months before the military regime collapsed as a result of the Falklands War , and gave a series of concerts at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires, where she invited many of her younger colleagues to share the stage. A double album of recordings from these performances became an instant best seller. She then traveled to perform in her home province of Tucuman. However, these performances were largely ignored by mainstream media in the country. [ 17 ] In subsequent years, Sosa continued to tour both in Argentina and abroad, performing in such venues as the Lincoln Center in New York City and the Théâtre Mogador in Paris. In poor health for much of the 1990s, she performed a comeback show in Argentina in 1998. [ 8 ] In 1994, she played in the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. [ 4 ] In 2002, she sold out both Carnegie Hall in New York and the Colosseum in Rome in the same year. [ 4 ] Sosa in 1973 A supporter of Perón , she favored leftist causes throughout her life. She supported President Raul Alfonsin in the election of 1983 which marked the return of democracy in Argentina following the dictatorship. She referred to this election as \"Argentina\\'s Spring\" [ 18 ] She opposed President Carlos Menem , who was in office from 1989 to 1999, and supported the election of Néstor Kirchner , who became president in 2003. [ 19 ] Sosa was a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Latin America and the Caribbean. [ 10 ] [ 20 ] Sosa disliked being identified as a protest singer. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] While she was outright in her political stances, Sosa said the following on the position of the artist: “An artist isn’t political in the party political sense – they have a constituency, which is their public – it is the poetry that matters most of all.” In a career spanning four decades, she worked with performers across several genres and generations, folk, opera, pop, rock, including Martha Argerich , Andrea Bocelli , David Broza , Franco Battiato , Jaime Roos , Joan Baez , Francis Cabrel , Gal Costa , Luz Casal , Lila Downs , Lucio Dalla , Maria Farantouri , Lucecita Benitez , Nilda Fernández , Charly Garcia , León Gieco , Gian Marco , Nana Mouskouri , Pablo Milanés , Holly Near , Milton Nascimento , Pata Negra , Fito Páez , Franco De Vita , Lourdes Pérez , Luciano Pavarotti , Silvio Rodríguez , Ismael Serrano , Shakira , Sting , Caetano Veloso , [ 4 ] Julieta Venegas , Gustavo Cerati and Konstantin Wecker [ 10 ] Sosa participated in a 1999 production of Ariel Ramírez \\'s Misa Criolla . [ 23 ] Her song Balderrama is featured in the 2008 movie Che , starring Benicio del Toro as the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara . [ 24 ] Sosa was the co-chair of the Earth Charter International Commission. Awards [ edit ] Sosa won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2000 ( Misa Criolla ), [ 25 ] 2003 ( Acústico ), [ 26 ] 2006 ( Corazón Libre ), [ 27 ] 2009 ( Cantora 1 , which also won Best Recording Package and was nominated for Album of the Year ), [ 28 ] and 2011 ( Deja La Vida Volar ), [ 29 ] as well as several international awards. In 1995, Konex Foundation from Argentina granted her the Diamond Konex Award , one of the most prestigious awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in the popular music of her country in the last decade.

In his review for Cantora 1 he wrote that \"contrary to the quintessential Sosa recordings, Cantora is a fairly subdued affair, with most songs whispered against unobtrusive yet tasteful acoustic arrangements by Poppi Spatocco\", also commenting that the production \"certainly works very well, as it creates an encompassing sonic texture that helps to render the entire album less dissimilar than it may have been\". [ 12 ] In the review for Cantora 2 he wrote that both albums as a whole are \"a touching, dignified conclusion to a musical legacy that is as enormous as it is precious\" while also calling \"Canción Para un Niño de la Calle\", the collaboration with Puerto Rican rapper Residente , as \"the highlight of the entire project\".

Like my predecessor Noah Strycker I will count heard-only birds, but I will differentiate between heard-only- and seen species to make sure my list stays comparable. During my 'Biggest Year' I will raise money for the groundbreaking Birdlife Preventing Extinctions Programme in a collaboration with Vogelbescherming Nederland and the Dutch Birding Association. This programme aims to prevent the extinction of all globally threatened bird species by applying an active, innovative and highly effective methodology.

I was excited and a bit afraid of the task at hand. I had to find my way across a city with 14 million inhabitants to my hotel, the Capsule Inn. That's right, I was sleeping in a capsule tonight. You see, booking an overnight stay in downtown Tokyo during the holidays can be terribly expensive, unless you are prepared to sleep in a 2 m2 room. Luckily, using the Tokyo public transportation system proved much easier than expected. All metro and train stations are named in English and everything is color-coded, making Tokyo actually the easiest mega-city to get around! I arrived at the Capsule Inn around 9 PM and after a fantastic Japanese dinner I went to bed. Four hours later I was awake again thanks to my jetlag and lying awake in a capsule for four hours is not the best feeling in the world ... At 6:30 the alarm went off and my ordeal was over! I had breakfast and took a metro to Yoyogi Station, where I was met by Chris Cook, my guide for today. Together we walked to Yoyogi Park where we started birding. My two main targets were quickly found, the Varied Tit and Japanese Pygmy-woodpecker. Pale and Dusky Thrushes were feeding on the parks open fields and we found a nice flock of wintering Mandarin Ducks on a small pond. From Yoyogi Station we took the metro to Kasai Rinkai Koen at the other side of Tokyo, which is situated at Tokyo Bay. We found out that we were not the only birders out birding with Christmas. There were literally hundreds of photographers and birders in Kasai Rinkai Park! Great to see that birding is hot and happening in Japan! We did find some great birds here, best of the bunch being the gulls. Kamchatca, Black-tailed, Vega and Slaty-backed Gull were all seen and a real bonus was an adult Saunders's Gull found by Chris. Another unexpected find were two Black-faced Spoonbills. At noon I said goodbye to Chris and finished the day birding till dusk before I took a metro to the airport, where I boarded my flight to Taipei, Taiwan .

Together we drove to the Dasyueshan Forest where we checked in at our hotel for a couple of hours of sleep. As soon as it was light enough we started birding, initially focusing on the lower part of the mountain range. As always on an island with a good number of endemics, new species kept rolling in during these first couple of hours of birding. Highlights were Yellow Tit, Taiwan Hwamei, Steere's Liocichla and a wintering - and calling - Kamchatka Leaf-warbler, a recent split from the Arctic Warbler-complex. A little bit higher up the mountain we had no trouble finding the beautiful Swinhoe's Pheasant and Taiwan Whistling-Thrush and Taiwan Wren-babbler where the only ones for the trip. In the afternoon we drove up a road with one of the best scenery's I encountered this whole year. It is great to see that Taiwan's Mountains are still covered in extensive forest. Another great thing was that we encountered hundreds of local birdwatchers and especially photographers looking for Taiwan's sought after endemic birds. After my experience in Japan it became clear to me that birding and photography is booming in East Asia! At the highest part of the Dasyueshan road we found the sought after Collared Bush-robin and Flamecrest, but I was especially pleased with Taiwan Fulvetta and Taiwan Rosefinch. Quite interesting were local forms of White-backed Woodpecker, Eurasian Wren and Eurasian Nutcracker. The star bird - Mikado Pheasant - however did not show itself at its usual stakeout. Swinhoe's Pheasant Lophura swinhoii (Arjan Dwarshuis) White-whiskered Laughingthrush Garrulax cineraceus (Arjan Dwarshuis) Taiwanese mountains (Arjan Dwarshuis) December 27th CHASNG TAIWAN ENDEMICS We had done pretty well yesterday which meant that today would of course be a little bit more challenging. We started our quest for the remaining Taiwan endemic where we'd left off, in the mountains. Here we quickly found our first target, a covey of Taiwan Partridges. We tried without success for the elusive Rusty Laugingthrush before we headed downhill to look for Taiwan Blue Magpie and Chestnut-bellied Tit in a different valley. During our first stop we found the Magpie and after a bit of searching we managed to get fantastic looks at the tit. In the late afternoon we went up into the mountains one last time to try for Mikado Pheasant, but again this fantastic species refused to show itself; quite a painful dip as you can imagine.

I was ready to check in for my flight to Vietnam when I found out that my visa was not in order. It would take at least five hours to fix this, so of course I missed my flight. I had to spend the whole day on Taipei airport before I could finally get on a new flight to Ho Chi Min City, which left at 7 PM. I made a whole lot of extra unnecessary costs and arrived in Vietnam just before midnight. Of course I did not see any new species today. I guess it had to happen at some point, so better all the way at the tail end of my Biggest Year. December 29th VIETNAM, MY LAST COUNTRY THIS YEAR! Last night I was picked up from Ho Chi Min Airport by my guide - Phuc Le - for the remaining three days of my Biggest Year in Vietnam. This beautiful country has always been high on my whish list, not just for its impressive list of endemics and other special birds, but also for the great food and the friendly people. Phuc and I drove four hours to Cat Tien National Park where arrived around 2:30 AM. This gave me just enough time for a couple of hours of much needed sleep. After a quick noodle soup breakfast it was time to start birding. Phuc decided that we would first head off to the grasslands to look for the endangered Green Peafowl which is arguably the most beautiful of all pheasants. During the walk to the grasslands we found Golden-crested Myna's, Grey-faced Tit-babbler and Grey-headed Parakeet. In the grasslands it took a bit of searching, but eventually we found two stunning Green Peafowls. Around midday bird activity stopped so I decided to take a well-deserved afternoon nap. In the afternoon we went after the two species of Pitta that can be found in the park. We got splendid views of Bar-bellied Pitta, but Blue-rumped Pitta unfortunately was only heard. Green Peafowl Pavo muticus (Arjan Dwarshuis) Bar-bellied Pitta Pitta elliotii (Arjan Dwarshuis) December 30th ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE EVERYTHING WORKS You have some of those days where everything works perfectly, today turned out to be such a day. It already started great with an amazing dawn chorus of a family of Red-cheeked Gibbons. Half an hour later we took a jeep ride to Crocodile Lake. Shortly after our arrival two Germain's Peacock-Pheasants started calling and after some playback of their calls I actually got to see one really well as it crept across the forest floor. 15 Minutes later we were looking at a family of three Dusky Broadbills, but the best sighting of the morning was still to come. Totally unexpected we bumped into a small covey of the rare Orange-necked Partridge, which is probably the hardest specialty to find in the whole park. Great stuff. After packing our bags we commenced with the 2,5 hour drive to Nui San Pass, a birding site half way between Cat Tien and Dalat. When we arrived at Nui San Pass it was around 2:30 PM and there was absolutely zero bird activity. That's the beauty of birding, out of the blue things can change dramatically. Suddenly we heard a huge flock of birds approaching through the forest and moments later we were seeing dozens of Black-capped Parrotbills, Black-hooded Laughingthrushes, Red-billed Scimitar-babbler and to top things off several Vietnamese Cutias, Yellow-billed Nuthatches and two Indochinese Green Magpies. At the top we focused on the rare and notoriously skulking Orange-breasted Laughingthrush and after playing hide-and-seek with this bird for half an hour I had fantastic looks at one. When it became dark we continued to Dalat. Here we met up for some beers with Tjeerd Burger, André Willem Faber and Jaap Hennevanger. These three Dutch birders would join us tomorrow for the last day of my Biggest Year!

Today was a special day, the last one of my Biggest Year that is! Unfortunately it was raining cats-and-dogs when we left Dalat town. I was telling Tjeerd, Jaap and Adre that this was about the worst weather I endured this entire year. ‘What?! THIS is the worst weather you’ve had ALL YEAR?!’ Indeed I have been incredibly lucky this year. Not just with the weather, but also with flights, political situations and my health; I haven’t been sick for a single day! That alone is crazy, normally I get sick at least once or twice a year. I guess being out and about and doing the thing you love all day is generally good for your health. Also it probably helped that I never drank more than one or two beers a day, making sure I was fresh the next day, both physically and mentally. We had three challenging target birds this last day of the year. The Grey-crowned Crocias, Collared Laughingthrush and Black-crowned Fulvetta. All three are endemic to Vietnam, all three are rare and all three are beautiful. We spent the first three hours of day looking for the laughingthrush, but all we got was wet to the bone. Later in the morning we connected with our first – and my personally most wanted – target, the unique and endangered Grey-crowned Crocias. We found at least two birds moving with a big mixed species flock that also contained Vietnamese Cutias and the Grey-crowned Bush-tit, a likely future split from, Black-throated Bush-tit. Due to the horrendous weather I couldn’t take out my camera all day, so no photos of this beauty unfortunately. Another good bird this morning was the endemic Vietnamese Greenfinch, as well as the range-restricted Slender-billed Oriole. In the afternoon we drove two hours to Bidoup NP, the last birding site for me this year. You could see the effects of the heavy rain. The river had swallowed entire coffee plantations, houses and unfortunately for us, also the trail system in the park. We tried crossing a newly formed stream bare foot, only to find out that there was an even bigger and faster flowing stream two hundred meters ahead. After freeing a Vietnamese family whose car got stuck on the muddy road, we decided it was probably best to focus our energy to the roadside for the last half hour of daylight. Here that last bit of Biggest Year-magic happened. With only 20 minutes of daylight left I suddenly heard a Collared Laughingthrush responding in the distance. We managed to get closer to the bird and ten minutes later we all got views of this incredibly good looking and endangered Laughingthrush that skulked through the undergrowth. We walked back to the car, having given up on the fulvetta, but Phuc decided to play the song of the bird one last time and behold, we got a response! While it was slowly becoming too dark to bird we had fantastic views of my last possible Vietnamese endemic this year. After dinner, a quick powernap and a shower, we headed into Dalat town for my first and last day of boozing this whole year! Cheers! It was an incredible year! I will soon post an epilogue of my Biggest Year.

When Arjan Dwarshuis first heard of the “Big Year”—the legendary record for birdwatching—he was twenty years old, it was midnight, and he was sitting on the roof of a truck in the Andean Mountains. In that moment he promised himself that, someday, somehow, he would become a world-record-holding birder. Ten years later, he embarked on an incredible, arduous, and perilous journey that took him around the globe; over uninhabited islands, through dense unforgiving rainforests, across snowy mountain peaks and unrelenting deserts—in just a single year. Would he survive? Would he be able to break the “Big Year” record, navigating through a world filled with shifting climate and geopolitical challenges? The (Big) Year that Flew By is an unforgettable, personal exploration of the limits of human potential when engaging with the natural world. It is a book about birds and birding and Arjan’s attempts to raise awareness for critically endangered species, but it is also a book about overcoming mental challenges, extreme physical danger, and human competition and fully realizing your passions through nature, adventure, and conservation. “Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.” ― Booklist “I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” —The Washington Post Reviews and Praise “Dutch birders take their pursuit to a higher plane of skill and intensity, as exemplified in this global trek by Arjan Dwarshuis. A fast-paced page-turner and a unique adventure story, The (Big) Year that Flew By is also filled with insights about landscapes, people, and a world of wonderful birds.” —Kenn Kaufman, author of Kingbird Highway More Reviews and Praise “Arjan artistically weaves together the beauty of the birds, the importance of conservation, and the complex logistics of non-stop travel. The roller coaster highs of seeing a target bird, paired with the lows of absolute fatigue and exhaustion, are an innate undertone of any birder’s big year.” —Tiffany Kersten, birding guide and continental U.S. Big Year record holder “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is not simply a celebration of a broken record but a global call to action to protect the habitats that birds rely on for survival. A Big Year of birding is a massive undertaking, requiring a Herculean effort to successfully plan and execute. While this quest involves daunting logistics and emotional hurdles, the most notable achievement is distilling so much lived experience into a single book. Arjan has conquered both, beautifully capturing remote wild places and conveying the intensity endured to find and observe nearly three-quarters of the world’s bird species. Arjan’s contagious passion for birds infuses his account of a global avian scavenger hunt like no other.” —Christian Hagenlocher, author of the Falcon Freeway “An astonishing achievement! Arjan Dwarshuis’s year was so big it covered an entire planet. His eagle eyes took in almost 7,000 species of bird and brought into sharp focus their often-fragile existence. Dwarshuis’s heartfelt prose reminds us that many of these species are living on the edge—just a generation or two away from extinction. Yet this is a story of hope—Dwarshuis shines a light on the many communities around the world banding together to save their local birdlife. This book is a glorious tribute to the wealth of beauty and diversity found in birds, and a clarion call for us all to care about the future of birds everywhere. “ —Neil Hayward, author of Lost Among the B irds “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is somehow both a fast-paced race through and an in-depth immersion in an amazing birding big year. Arjan Dwarshuis does an excellent job of portraying the excitement, stress, and exertion that are part of any Big Year, but that was even more so in his record-breaking worldwide Big Year. I very much enjoyed reading his account, sometimes with my heart pounding, as I lived his journey with him, feeling joy when he managed to find another rarity, concern with his bird-seeking struggles, and sorrow in his very rare misses. As I read, I continued to be impressed by the logistics required for all his travels, and by the excellent people who helped him find all these bird species. His interspersing of tales of his early birding years helped me better understand the how and why he was able to pull off his remarkable feat as well as his passion for birding. Throughout this book, he also explained conservation concerns and advances as they relate to the birds he sought, providing words of wisdom and words of hope. In his conclusion, he admits that while flying all over the world does use much energy, ecotourism in many far-flung places has been and continues to be of great importance in saving birds and habitats. I especially appreciate his conclusion in which he asks his readers to adopt a positive attitude and do their part—'enjoy nature and look up to the sky.’” —Lynn Barber, author of Extreme Birder “Arjan’s story is brilliantly told. I was with him every step of the way. It is much more than just a story about one man’s bid to see as most of the world’s bird species in one year as humanly possible. No, this is an epic journey by a man who’s not only obsessed with birds but who has a deep spiritual connection with the planet as he observes the environments and habitats he encounters. It is clear that we have to do more to take care of our world and all its inhabitants, including us.” —David Lindo, author of How to be an Urban Birder \"[An] entertaining debut . . . . [that] offers colorful glimpses into the locales the author visits. . . . Part birding journal, part travelogue, this will appeal to backyard birders.\" — Publisher's Weekly \"Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.\" — Booklist \"I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” — The Washington Post About Arjan Dwarshuis Arjan Dwarshuis , a professional bird guide, writer, and lecturer, holds the current Guinness Book World Record for observing the largest number of bird species in a single year. In 2016, he launched his global “Big Year” and ultimately observed 6,852 of the world’s roughly 10,700 bird species, setting a record that stands to this day. His yearlong adventure raised nearly $50,000 for the BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Program. Arjan also starred in the award-winning documentary Arjan’s Big Year and appears regularly on radio, television, and podcast programs in the Netherlands and beyond. He is a columnist for several magazines about nature, and as the ambassador for the IUCN NL Land Acquisition Fund, he is committed to the protection of birds across the globe.

The Black-bellied Hummingbird is one of the latest species Arjan Dwarshuis found in Costa Rica during his quest to break the global Big Year record and see 7,000 types of birds. Photo: Francesco Veronesi /Flickr CC (BY-SA 2.0) By Noah Strycker Contributor, Audubon Magazine Published November 17, 2016 Eleven months have passed since I wrapped up my Birding Without Borders quest: a world tour of 41 countries and seven continents, during which I recorded 6,042 species of birds in one whirlwind year. It was an incredible trip, and I’m now finishing a book about the experience. Sure, it was fun to set a world record, but I knew the number wouldn’t last forever. In fact, it stood just one year. Last week, Dutch birder Arjan Dwarshuis topped 6,100 species of birds so far in 2016, and he’s still going strong. He was in Costa Rica when he surpassed my total, logging a Black-bellied Hummingbird as one of his latest additions . Since January, Dwarshuis, a 30-year-old bartender and cooking enthusiast from Amsterdam, has crisscrossed Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and South and Central America with the single goal of notching as many bird species as possible. He has yet to visit North America, and plans to finish up with a return to Asia in December. “I’m very, very pleased,” he said in an interview with a Dutch news site. “Pleased that I broke the record; pleased that I broke it so early in the year.” Along the way, Dwarshuis received help from many birders—and all for a good cause. On a JustGiving page , he urges his followers to donate to BirdLife International’s Preventing Extinctions Programme, and has raised nearly $12,000, mostly from folks in the Netherlands.

Thank you so much #swarovskioptik and #vogelinformatiecentrumtexel for this awesome equipment! #birding #biggestyear #surinam #sponsoring photo by Humberto Tan A photo posted by Arjan Dwarshuis (@arjandwarshuis) on Jul 15, 2016 at 7:46am PDT It has been interesting to keep tabs on his progress after my own Big Year in 2015, when I eclipsed the existing record of 4,341 set by British birders Ruth Miller and Alan Davies in 2008. Each new attempt builds on the last, incorporating fresh knowledge and strategies, and I’m happy to see the torch passed on. Dwarshuis has followed a similar route and approach to mine with a few tweaks. Of the 41 countries I visited last year, he elected not to go to Antarctica, Cameroon, or Myanmar (where I averaged fewer unique species) while substituting some destinations that I missed: Ethiopia, Malawi, a couple of Caribbean islands, Suriname, and Java. He’s succeeded in pacing each leg based on the number of species that might be found there, keeping up the daily average of new sightings. Like me, he has depended heavily on local birding communities, offset his carbon emissions, and submitted sightings to an online database that tracks bird populations (I used eBird.org ; he uses observation.org ). I hope these strategies will become standard for future Big Years, should others take up the challenge. It’s also worth noting that Dwarshuis plays by a different taxonomy, which has caused some confusion with numbers. Instead of the Clements Checklist (used for all previous global Big Years), he follows the IOC World Bird List , a progressive authority that recognizes more species. By that measure (IOC v. 6.3), my 2015 year list was 6,153 species, which Dwarshuis has also now passed. With just seven weeks to go, Dwarshuis is aiming for 7,000—and who knows? With a productive session in North America this month and a fast end-of-the-year tour through Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan, he might just make it. In any case, the Big Year record is getting a major shake-up. Records, of course, are made to be broken, and any number is evanescent compared to the experience behind it. (A similarly thrilling contest is brewing in North America this year.) Each Big Year is a personal journey, like climbing a high peak or even mastering a soufflé. Birding, in its many variations, celebrates the infinite details of life on Earth—and birds can help illuminate the world in unexpected ways. In the context of other headlines this week, I think a global birdwatching record is especially symbolic: It shows that no one is truly isolated, and that great things are achieved by working together across all kinds of borders. I tip my hat to Arjan Dwarshuis, the new Big Year record holder, and wish him good birding for the rest of the year.

His guide plunged in, bare-footed. Nils paused, then followed. He breathed a sigh of relief. But 10 minutes later, the narrow canyon meant they had to cross the stream again. The guide shrugged. Bouillard realized this was going to be a very long afternoon and not the gentle one-hour hike he was promised. Twenty stream crossings later, he finally arrived. And he achieved his goal: seeing an endemic species of bat. Yes, a bat. Nils had not only trekked the treacherous path, he had traveled more than 9,000 miles from home to do so. Last year, Nils embarked on one of the more unusual nature quests: to see as many bat species around the world as he could in a year. A Big Bat Year. Photo © Nils Bouillard He modeled the idea on the popular concept of the Big Year in birding, where birders attempt to see as many bird species as possible in one calendar year. A Big Year might be in a yard , a county, a state or a continent. Lately, the global Big Year has achieved the status of sporting even for bird nerds, with enthusiasts tracking the travels of birding celebrities as they tick species after species. The Big Year has spawned its own sub-genre of books and blogs, and even a popular Hollywood film. Let’s get this out of the way: Bat watching is not birding. Nils acknowledges this up front. “A lot of bats are small and brown,” he says. “They’re not easy to see. Many only are active at night. Some species you can only determine using ridiculously difficult ID features like comparing the first and second phalanx of the thumb.” But look more deeply into the world of bats, Nils argues, and you’ll find a surprising array of interesting little animals. You’ll see some of the greatest natural spectacles on earth. And unlike birding – where the path is well trod – batting offers the chance for genuine exploration, even discovery. A Mexican free-tailed bat in Eckert James River Bat Cave Preserve in Mason, Texas. Photo © Karine Aigner From Birds to Bats Nils’s fascination with bats began, perhaps paradoxically, with birds. He had been getting serious about birds and exploring the local natural areas around his Belgian home. He was invited to take part in a local bat survey near the town of Chimay, a town more famous for beer than bats. “When I saw my first bat, a gray long-eared bat, up close, I just fell in love with them,” he says. “I wanted to know everything about them.” Nils Bouillar records bat echolocation calls. Photo © Nils Bouillard He began taking others for walks to look for bats, and realized that, while many people had misperceptions about the flying mammals, they also were open to learning. About the same time, he began following the adventures of birding Big Year superstars like Noah Strycker and Arjan Dwarshuis. After completing a master’s degree in ecology, he decided it was time to go batting around the world. He noted that most bat enthusiasts were more about the creatures themselves than lists. But he found himself thinking about applying birding concepts to batting, and launched the idea for his own Bat Big Year. “There are about 1,400 species of bats on earth,” he says. “I wanted a way to educate people about this diversity and to encourage people to conserve these mammals.” “The rules for a birding Big Year are well established,” says Nils. “For bats, I had to establish my own rules for what counted.” This could prove tricky, as bats are not nearly as visible as birds. Nils decided the following would count on his list: any bat in hand (when netted or caught by a researcher), roosting bats that could be positively identified and bat echolocation calls he recorded on a bat detector. Bats just darting by in the air can usually not be identified, so they didn’t count. Mexican free-tailed bats departing the Bracken Bat Cave in Texas. Photo © Karine Aigner / TNC A Lot of Bats And how did Nils fare? He acknowledges it was harder than he thought, as finding bats on his own in unfamiliar places proved a significant challenge. The emotional toll of being away from home so frequently cost him his relationship. He felt homesick, particularly when the batting proved difficult. As he wrote on his blog: “I also had no idea how challenging finding the bats would actually be. Trip reports make it sound easy but the reality is very different. The rules I have set myself probably didn’t help in that regard as they have cost me a number of species but I had to set some limitations and I decided to be quite stringent with them.” Still, he saw bats. Lots of bats. He traveled to 29 countries on six continents, and saw 396 species. (As a comparison, Arjan Dwarshuis’s record-breaking birding Big Year netted 6,852 species). Along the way, Nils rediscovered a bat species thought extinct in New Caledonia. He documented a potentially new bat species, one of his childhood dreams. He visited Texas’s Bracken Cave, thought to be home to the largest bat colony on earth, with legendary bat conservationist Merlin Tuttle. Merlin Tuttle and Nils Bouillard. Photo © MerlinTuttle.org / Rozanne Rathge “The people I met made the trip,” says Nils. “As my year progressed, other bat enthusiasts learned about what I was doing, and invited me to visit. I met up with researchers and volunteers who shared my passion, and who were interested in advocating for bat conservation.” Nils spent time in the Pacific, where many islands have endemic species. (The Solomon Islands, for instance, have 40 bat species). He spent 16 days in the Phillipines, where he saw the world’s largest bat – Acerodon jubatus – as well as spectacular bat caves. He observed spectacular yellow-wing bats using building roofs as perches to hunt at night in central Kenya and peered in “leaf tents” at roosting Honduran white bats in Costa Rica.

He continues to advocate for the protection of bats. “It’s a sensitive time for bat conservation,” he says. “Bats get blamed for a lot. But most people don’t hate them, they just don’t know much about them. That’s a starting point for education.” That includes responsible bat viewing. Nils didn’t enter any caves in North America due to potential spread of white-nose syndrome, a fungus that is devastating bats. He is careful not to disturb roosting bats. But he believes that bat tourism has potential in many parts of the world. Grey-headed flying foxes in Australia. Photo © Aaron Fellmeth Photography / Flickr Batting for the Casual Naturalist While Nils holds a slight hope someone will follow in his footsteps, and perhaps break his record, he’s also realistic. “It was very challenging in every way,” he says. “And bat listing is never going to be like birding.” However, along the way he found many eco-tourism opportunities that could introduce people to bats. The emergence of thousands or millions of bats from caves is an impressive spectacle that can be enjoyed by anyone. Some reserves, like Tirimbina in Costa Rica, will take naturalists out on bat netting surveys. Nils even found a community in Thailand that would take visitors out to see one spectacular species, the painted bat. “I think casual batting has a lot of potential, especially as an offering at eco-lodges,” he says. “When local people realize they can make an income from preserving species, whether birds or bats, it can lead to better protection.” And now that Nils is back at home, with no travel possible? He’s still batting. “I can walk out of my house in Belgium and see bats,” he says. “I’ve recorded seven species so far. I’m still a bat fanatic. And one of the best parts of this big year is that I’ve learned there are many others like me.” Published on June 15, 2020 - Updated on February 6, 2023 Join the Discussion Show comments (3) Join the Discussion Cancel reply Please note that all comments are moderated and may take some time to appear.

I gauge the seasons by the nightly appearance of canyon bats when the temperatures rise, visiting Mexican free-tailed bats– mothers and pups– from May to October, and lesser long-nosed bats drinking each night at my hummingbird feeders from August through September https://radio.azpm.org/p/radio-azspot-episodes/2016/7/14/91965-the-art-of-paying-attention-bats/ Reply Steve Plumb says: June 19, 2020 The painted bat looked fantastic so I did a search to find more pictures. I was shocked to find that many of them where from ebay where one can buy preserved bats to collect. As they are mammals and many are endangered it seems this shouldn’t be legal. I recall many caves and roosts are off limits to humans. Isn’t there a general ban on wildlife import? Or is that just for the living? Reply Michael Marchiano says: June 18, 2020 Being a Bat enthusiast myself, I really enjoyed the article. Over the years as a naturalist I have tried especially hard to dispel the general public’s ignorance  and prejudices for many of our maligned creatures, bats included. (the others being, snakes, spiders, scorpions and a large part of the insect world) I was really amazed at the number of species he was able to see and identify……I firmly believe in his conclusion about eco-tourism….give the public a chance to educate themselves and slowly we over come our fears and ignorance.

Today was on my own turf, a big day in the Netherlands, in the Dutch Delta estuary system more specifically.... I met the team 7:00 AM sharp at The Hague Central Station. Vincent van der Spek, Rinse van der Vliet, Max van Waasdijk - my travel companion for the next 2.5 months - and of course my girlfriend Camilla Dreef, an avid birdwatcher herself. The game was on! Our first target was a difficult one, Twite. However we had remarkably little difficulty as 3 birds dropped in overhead while we were watching a mixed group of Chilean and European Flamingos in the twilights. Next on the agenda were two other passerines that - like the Twite - normally make their home on the windswept tundra, Snow Bunting and Shore Lark. As with the Twite we immediately struck gold. While enjoying these stunning birds suddenly a huge bird swept overhead, WHITE-TAILED EAGLE!! An unexpected bonus. Right on schedule we headed to what could possibly be my first lifer for this Biggest Year, the female Pine Bunting that had chosen the Dutch delta as its unlikely wintering ground. Within minutes of arrival I marveled at this huge Dutch rarity! We were smashing through the delta like an elephant through a porcelain cabinet! At the bunting site we were informed about a Long-eared Owl roost in the village of Oostkapelle. The birds were quickly found and it was a real treat to see Camilla with a broad grin on her face as she photographed what is possibly our planet's most beautiful owl! We kept our mental pace going and in quick succession we notched up quality birds like Black Guillemot, Shag, 3 species of Diver, 4 species of Grebe, Razorbill, Gannet, an unexpected wintering Whimbrel, the vulnerable Velvet Scoter and Long-tailed Duck and the notoriously difficult Green Woodpecker and Grey Partridge. As dusk set in we enjoyed our last bird of the day: Pink-footed Goose. We tallied in at an amazing 118 species without even setting foot in a forest! A famous Dutch saying goes: 'Een goed begin is het halve werk', which means 'A good start is half the work'. Well I sure as hell hope so! What an awesome start to this Biggest Year! Dear friends, family and sweet Camilla, I will miss you... Off to the UAE! Pine Bunting Emberiza leucocephalos (Max van Waasdijk) January 2rd 2016: DIPPOCOLIUS After clearing customs at Dubai airport we met local birder Mike Barth for a solid day of chasing targets through the Emirates. The first target was immediately an important one, a monotypic family and a must-see for every serious world birder: Crab Plover. En route Mike - who quickly pointed out 2 stunning White-tailed Lapwings in the middle of a roundabout - told us about the difficulties for a birder living in Dubai. Because of the rapid ongoing spatial development in the Emirates the landscape changes constantly which means that a birding site could be good one day and turned into a building site the next day. Luckily the mudflats were still there and 6 Crab Plovers were quickly found. After admiring these highly sought after black-and-white waders we did what us Dutchmen do best, scoping for waders. This meant that we could add new year ticks in quick succession. After the wader bonanza and a quick stop for two Socotra Cormorants we headed to a small protected stretch of mangrove-forest where we enjoyed fantastic views of no less than 6 Greater Spotted Eagles circling overhead. A definite world rarity and a bird that is disappearing quickly in the western part of its range due to hybridization with Lesser Spotted Eagle. Next we drove out into the desert where we picked up the range-restricted winter visitor Red-tailed Wheatear and the ' Halimodendra ' subspecies of Lesser Whitethroat. At 4 PM we met local birder Oscar Campbell at the Abu Dhabi golf course to hopefully pick up the also monotypic and for me most wanted Grey Hypocolius. Oscar explained to us that the birds would surely fly overhead towards their roosting site in the mangroves so I kinda thought it would be a sure thing... Boy did I think wrong... The waiting was interrupted when I suddenly noticed a large white rumped swift flying past: PACIFIC SWIFT! The 4th record for the UAE! Oscar went bananas. Why does this happen here and never back home in the Netherlands (I also found the first Laughing Gull for the Gambia about a decade ago)? After a long wait Oscar picked up a group of passerines that were surely Hypocolius, but as soon as I got my bins on the very distant flock they disappeared behind the tribune of the Abu Dhabi race track. SHIT! All I had seen was a compact flock of long tailed birds with rounded wings, just not good enough for a tick, but you can bag to differ. Anyways it will not go on the list. So I opted for the new name Dippocolius. January 3rd DESERT DOWNPOURS Last night Mike had dropped us off at Laurent Frangies' place. A good friend of mine that I knew from uni and who now lives in Dubai! At 5:30 AM we left Laurent's place in his prized possession, a Toyota GX.R. To get into a winning mode we put on my playlist of 'glam rock' music and as we drove off into the desert Europe's 'Rock the Night' blazed through the speakers. At dawn we arrived at Wadi Masafi. A nice quiet gorge in the mountain range east of Dubai. The walk through the wadi was great and produced the range-restricted Plain Leaf Warbler, Scrub Warblers, lots of Desert Larks and Hume's Wheatear and another Red-tailed Wheatear. While enjoying these desert specialties dark thunderclouds packed over our heads and as we drove towards the coast we soon found ourselves in a tropical downpour, in the middle of the desert! We decided to shelter at a local restaurant right at the beach and while Laurent enjoyed his well-deserved coffee we scoped the sea. Not a bad decision as we soon found several Persian Shearwaters foraging offshore! An unexpected bonus and lifer! As we drove further south along the coast we checked for flocks of gulls and terns and after doing so for half an hour we hit the Jackpot, a huge flock of terns and gulls right on the beach! We counted no less than 7 different species of tern and 5 species of gull! Among them a fantastic White-cheeked tern that allowed Max some great photo opportunities. In addition to this we had close-up views of a Saunders Tern, only reliable here as the very similar Little Tern does not occur this time of the year in the UAE. We had a plane to catch so we drove back towards Dubai, but not before a toilet break materialized into an unexpected pair of Black-crowned Sparrow-lark! We said goodbye to Laurent and so is the first short leg of this Biggest Year completed, off to Sri Lanka!! White-tailed Lapwing Vanellus leucurus (Max van Waasdijk) Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga (Max van Waasdijk) Red-tailed Wheatear Oenanthe chrysopygia (Max van Waasdijk) White-cheeked Tern Sterna repressa (Max van Waasdijk) January 4th THE JUICE IS WORTH THE SQUEEZE When on a Biggest Year you can't afford to 'chill' since the clock is constantly ticking and you need to be constantly ticking. So after a delayed 4 hour flight to Colombo - Sri Lanka - and another 4 hours by minivan we arrived at Sinharaja right at the crack of dawn! What a change of scene, yesterday afternoon we were birding in the desert, now we found ourselves in hot steaming lowland forest! I've never had a warmer welcome anywhere than here in Sri Lanka, Jetwing Ecoholidays had provided us with our own minivan and driver, a very knowledgeable and friendly guide Shantha and a gift bag containing an illustrated checklist, the birdguide for Sri Lanka and a Hawaii-shirt with birds on it! What an ospious start to my Biggest Year! Soon we found ourselves on the Sinharaja trail system chasing endemics. The trick in Sinharaja is to find that mega mixed feeding-flock, but as the morning ticked away and the sun began to burn we failed to do so... We were just starting to worry when the game-changer came. A loud 'Pjong!' echoed through the forest, our guide froze and esthetically whispered 'Green-billed Coucal'! Seconds later we marveled at the beast that produced this bizarre call, we were back in the game! We had found a Spot-winged Thrush, Malabar Trogon and a very tame flock of the radiant Ceylon Blue Magpie, but still no feeding flock... Than it happened, the typical sound of a feeding flock rose in the distance and the first birds started dropping in overhead. Moments later we were surrounded by birds: another Green-billed Coucal, Blue Magpies, the rare Ashy-headed Laughingthrush, a pair of Crimson-baked Flamebacks and many Orange-billed and Sri Lankan Scimitar-Babblers, fantastic! We had just finished our very tasty lunch when Shantha urged us to go back to the van. To our surprise we didn't drove down, but back up again to where we had come from. Turned out one of the local guides had found a roosting Serendip Scops Owl, an endangered bird described new to science only as recent as 2004! We enjoyed reasonable views as the bird remained well hidden in a vine tangle, but any more movement from our side would surely disturb this threatened species, so we refrained from going any closer. What a day! We walked back to the van, but Shantha had one more surprise for us up his sleeve, a fantastic pair of Ceylon Frogmouth! Now completely satisfied and completely exhausted we fell asleep in the back of the van during the 6 hour drive towards the Horton Plains... Ceylon Frogmouth Batrachostomus moniliger (Max van Waasdijk) Ceylon Blue Magpie Urocissa ornata (Max van Waasdijk) Green-billed Coucal Centropus chlororhynchos (Max van Waasdijk) Red-faced malkoha Phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus (Max van Waasdijk) January 5th HORTON PLAINS POWER PLAY The alarm rang at 04:30 AM, a bit of a petty since we were staying at the very luxurious Jetwing St. Andrews Hotel and we had no time to enjoy this fantastic place - sponsored to us by Jetwing Ecoholidays - during day-time. However, we were here on a mission to notch-up all the Sri Lanka endemics in just a couple of days, so resting would have to come some other time. We reached the gates of Horton Plains NP still in the twilight, but already there was a huge assemblage of minivans filled with eager tourist wanting to reach 'The World's End' lookout point in time to see the sunrise. We however had a very different reason to be here so early, namely the shy and endangered Ceylon Whistling-thrush. The Whistling-thrush-site was a scenic one, a small lily-covered pond near a stream surrounded by cloud-forest-covered hillsides, not a bad place to start off the day! We were there for barely 5 minutes when I flushed a bird from the roadside, the blue shine on its back was unmistakable and I whispered 'Whistling-Thrush'! Luckily the bird perched for a few seconds, allowing excellent views of this world-rarity! After this flying start we kept the pace going and saw all the possible high-elevation endemics before 12 AM, however we still needed two highly sought-after winter migrants, Kashmir Flycatcher and the beautiful Pied Thrush. There was one small problem, we arrived at Victoria Park at midday, which made conditions for birding tough. Still we managed to obtain fantastic views of no less than 3 Pied Thrushes and a vagrant Eyebrowed Thrush behind a small toilet building. The flycatcher proved elusive today and despite 2,5 hours of intensive searching we just could not find it, the first real dip for our Sri Lanka trip was a fact. From the Horton Plains it was another 6 hours drive to the Jetwing Yala Hotel, which meant that the last hour automatically turned into a night drive. This materialized in a sighting of a Jungle Cat in the middle of the road, a fantastic finish and the missed flycatcher was quickly forgotten! Pied Thrush Geokichla wardii (Max van Waasdijk) January 6th BACK TO SINHARAJA A now familiar pre-dawn start meant that we arrived at Bungala National Park just as the sun rose over this beautiful wetland. As expected new birds came thick-and-fast and in addition to large numbers of waders and egrets we found several good species like Watercock, Spot-billed Pelican and Pallas's Grasshopper Warbler. I would have loved to spend more time in this lush wetland, but we had to leave early since there were still a couple of endemics lurking somewhere in the mountains of Sri Lanka... So after another 5 hour drive we were back were we had started, Sinharaja! This time with a very specific hit-list. First on this list was the Sri Lankan Thrush, a shy and rare Zoothera thrush that is notoriously difficult to find. Luck was on our side however, since it was dripping wet after a recent tropical downpour; ideal conditions for ground dwelling thrushes looking for tasty worms and snails! Soon a Thrush was flushed from the trail and perched for more than 10 minutes at eye-level, awesome! On the way back we had two close encounters with another endemic Zoothera , Spot-winged Thrush and our local guide pointed a second Serendip Scops Owl out for us, nice! This one allowed for better photo-opportunities than the one on the first day. Near the entrance we made short business of another target, White-faced Starling and moments later two Sri Lanka Grey Hornbills flew in! Now there were just two endemics left for us to find at Sinharaja! We spend the night in the lovely Martin's Lodge, just a stone's throw away from the Sinharaja gate and just as the sun set over the Sri Lankan mountains a Chestnut-backed Owlet began to call, one more endemic to go... Sri Lanka Thrush Zoothera imbricata (Max van Waasdijk) Spot-winged Thrush Geokichla spiloptera (Max van Waasdijk) Serendib Scops Owl Otus thilohoffmanni (Max van Waasdijk) January 7th ENDEMICS, GONNA CATCH 'M ALL! Today we were going after a notoriously shy gamebird, the Sri Lankan spurfowl. Well it used to be a challenging bird to come to grips with, but recently a stake-out had been found at the edge of the lower part of Sinharaja. A local community has started feeding the birds and every day around 9 AM this beautiful white-spotted bird creeps out of the forest to forage on seeds behind one of the houses. This is a great way to involve a local community in conservation practices, since they earn good money from visiting birders that hope to see the spurfowl, these people are strongly motivated to protect it. Initiatives like this are now set up all over the world and are beneficial to both birders, local people and most importantly birds! While we were waiting for this elusive skulker there was a lot of action in the lush rainforest surrounding the small village and to our big surprise we soon enjoyed fantastic views of both Green-billed Coucal and Red-faced Malkoha! Even rarer was a flock of 4 White-faced Starlings scoped in a distant tree. While enjoying a fantastic Chestnut-backed Owlet one of the elders came rushing in urging us to come with him and there it was, our last wet-zone endemic, Sri Lanka Spurfowl, what a stunning bird! After the Sinharja clean-up we drove down to the coast to find another target, this time not an endemic, but nevertheless a bird that I had been longing to see for quite some time now, Indian Pitta, hypothetically my 10th species in this most stunning of the worlds' bird families. And yes, Buddha was again good to us and we managed to find no less than 3 birds at a forest stakeout! Now we had one more day in Sri Lanka to hopefully find our final endemic, Sri Lanka Wood-shrike, a dry-zone specialist. I didn't expect this Sri Lanka trip to go this smooth and in retrospect I could have even done it in 4 days, well it was the first country that I had properly planned when constructing my Biggest Year itinerary (back than there were 'only' 23 countries in the itinerary, now there are 41), so I guess I have to give myself some slag. For everybody out there doubting whether I will be able to combine hardcore birding, making a documentary movie, blogging and fundraising simultaneously - read Leon - I love this and trust me, I will only step up my game from now on. I would like to stress one more time that with this Biggest Year I hope to raise awareness and funding for the Preventing Extinctions Programme, so to everybody reading and enjoying this blog, please do have a look at my Tilt fundraising page! Enjoying Chestnut-backed Owlet (Arjan Dwarshuis) Sri Lanka Spurfowl Galloperdix bicalcarata (Max van Waasdijk) January 8th GOODBYE BEAUTIFUL SRI LANKA Last night we had a fantastic dinner at the Jetwing Beach Resort with Keith Wijesuriya and his wife. Keith is the guy who invited me to come to Sri Lanka and arranged this fantastic trip sponsored by Jetwing Eco Holidays. After elaborating on the fantastic trip we had so far we suddenly noticed it was already 11 PM and since we woke at 4:30 AM I felt a bit shaky today, but as soon as I got my bins on a magnificent Brown Fish Owl - at a wetland reserve north of Colombo - I was back in business! We thoroughly enjoyed our final day on this lush island and managed to find the last of the endemics, Sri Lanka Woodshrike, a recent addition to the Sri Lanka list! We also saw the local red-backed subspecies of Black-rumped Flameback that will surely get split in the near future. We returned to the resort around lunchtime since I had an interview this afternoon with three journalist of three different Sri Lankan newspapers! Fantastic exposure for my trip and for my fundraiser so I was more than happy to do so (we had seen all the endemics anyhow). After the interview we had a couple of hours before our flight to India, so this gave me plenty time to finish-up this blog, enjoy! We will leave for India with 342 species in 8 days' time, not bad I would say. Happy Birding!

When Arjan Dwarshuis first heard of the “Big Year”—the legendary record for birdwatching—he was twenty years old, it was midnight, and he was sitting on the roof of a truck in the Andean Mountains. In that moment he promised himself that, someday, somehow, he would become a world-record-holding birder. Ten years later, he embarked on an incredible, arduous, and perilous journey that took him around the globe; over uninhabited islands, through dense unforgiving rainforests, across snowy mountain peaks and unrelenting deserts—in just a single year. Would he survive? Would he be able to break the “Big Year” record, navigating through a world filled with shifting climate and geopolitical challenges? The (Big) Year that Flew By is an unforgettable, personal exploration of the limits of human potential when engaging with the natural world. It is a book about birds and birding and Arjan’s attempts to raise awareness for critically endangered species, but it is also a book about overcoming mental challenges, extreme physical danger, and human competition and fully realizing your passions through nature, adventure, and conservation. “Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.” ― Booklist “I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” —The Washington Post Reviews and Praise “Dutch birders take their pursuit to a higher plane of skill and intensity, as exemplified in this global trek by Arjan Dwarshuis. A fast-paced page-turner and a unique adventure story, The (Big) Year that Flew By is also filled with insights about landscapes, people, and a world of wonderful birds.” —Kenn Kaufman, author of Kingbird Highway More Reviews and Praise “Arjan artistically weaves together the beauty of the birds, the importance of conservation, and the complex logistics of non-stop travel. The roller coaster highs of seeing a target bird, paired with the lows of absolute fatigue and exhaustion, are an innate undertone of any birder’s big year.” —Tiffany Kersten, birding guide and continental U.S. Big Year record holder “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is not simply a celebration of a broken record but a global call to action to protect the habitats that birds rely on for survival. A Big Year of birding is a massive undertaking, requiring a Herculean effort to successfully plan and execute. While this quest involves daunting logistics and emotional hurdles, the most notable achievement is distilling so much lived experience into a single book. Arjan has conquered both, beautifully capturing remote wild places and conveying the intensity endured to find and observe nearly three-quarters of the world’s bird species. Arjan’s contagious passion for birds infuses his account of a global avian scavenger hunt like no other.” —Christian Hagenlocher, author of the Falcon Freeway “An astonishing achievement! Arjan Dwarshuis’s year was so big it covered an entire planet. His eagle eyes took in almost 7,000 species of bird and brought into sharp focus their often-fragile existence. Dwarshuis’s heartfelt prose reminds us that many of these species are living on the edge—just a generation or two away from extinction. Yet this is a story of hope—Dwarshuis shines a light on the many communities around the world banding together to save their local birdlife. This book is a glorious tribute to the wealth of beauty and diversity found in birds, and a clarion call for us all to care about the future of birds everywhere. “ —Neil Hayward, author of Lost Among the B irds “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is somehow both a fast-paced race through and an in-depth immersion in an amazing birding big year. Arjan Dwarshuis does an excellent job of portraying the excitement, stress, and exertion that are part of any Big Year, but that was even more so in his record-breaking worldwide Big Year. I very much enjoyed reading his account, sometimes with my heart pounding, as I lived his journey with him, feeling joy when he managed to find another rarity, concern with his bird-seeking struggles, and sorrow in his very rare misses. As I read, I continued to be impressed by the logistics required for all his travels, and by the excellent people who helped him find all these bird species. His interspersing of tales of his early birding years helped me better understand the how and why he was able to pull off his remarkable feat as well as his passion for birding. Throughout this book, he also explained conservation concerns and advances as they relate to the birds he sought, providing words of wisdom and words of hope. In his conclusion, he admits that while flying all over the world does use much energy, ecotourism in many far-flung places has been and continues to be of great importance in saving birds and habitats. I especially appreciate his conclusion in which he asks his readers to adopt a positive attitude and do their part—'enjoy nature and look up to the sky.’” —Lynn Barber, author of Extreme Birder “Arjan’s story is brilliantly told. I was with him every step of the way. It is much more than just a story about one man’s bid to see as most of the world’s bird species in one year as humanly possible. No, this is an epic journey by a man who’s not only obsessed with birds but who has a deep spiritual connection with the planet as he observes the environments and habitats he encounters. It is clear that we have to do more to take care of our world and all its inhabitants, including us.” —David Lindo, author of How to be an Urban Birder \"[An] entertaining debut . . . . [that] offers colorful glimpses into the locales the author visits. . . . Part birding journal, part travelogue, this will appeal to backyard birders.\" — Publisher's Weekly \"Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.\" — Booklist \"I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” — The Washington Post About Arjan Dwarshuis Arjan Dwarshuis , a professional bird guide, writer, and lecturer, holds the current Guinness Book World Record for observing the largest number of bird species in a single year. In 2016, he launched his global “Big Year” and ultimately observed 6,852 of the world’s roughly 10,700 bird species, setting a record that stands to this day. His yearlong adventure raised nearly $50,000 for the BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Program. Arjan also starred in the award-winning documentary Arjan’s Big Year and appears regularly on radio, television, and podcast programs in the Netherlands and beyond. He is a columnist for several magazines about nature, and as the ambassador for the IUCN NL Land Acquisition Fund, he is committed to the protection of birds across the globe.

You Can Do Both! by | April 26, 2020 Tweet Virtually every D SLR today has the capability of shooting video but many who have shot some video often stopped after just a few attempts. Why? Because they did nothing with the video afterwards. This does not have to be. Editing, provided you don’t get too fancy, can be relatively easy and fast, once you know how. And, you can often extract usable stills from a video clip. That’s what I’d like to address here. In Photoshop, you can select a specific frame to extract as a still image and work on that frame much as you would do with any image. I’ve done this several times when, by only shooting video, I’ve missed a still shot. You can’t do stills and video simultaneously. Getting a high-quality image from a video clip depends upon the format that you captured the video with, and to some extent, how large a file you’ll want for the still image. For best results, 4K videos will give you the largest file size, typically around 4096 x 2160, which is about 4/5th the file size of some RAW formats. Provided the subject is still, you can make a good quality image from an extracted frame. And here’s the rub. You should shoot a 4K video at either 1/48th sec or 1/60th sec These recommended shutter speeds are twice the frame rate of the video capture, and that’s either 24fps or 30fps (frames per second), depending upon the video setting you are using. However, neither speed is conducive for capturing motion. You can shoot 4K video at higher shutter speeds to freeze motion, but the resulting video will look choppy or jerky. Some cameras offer high speed or slow motion video, at 120fps, and although the best shutter speed might be twice that, approximately 1/250th sec, you can go faster and the slow motion video will still look good. Sound isn’t recorded at that frame rate, and the file size may be only about 1/4th the size of a 4K capture. You can extract a frame for small images, appropriate for the web or for small prints, but the quality doesn’t compare with 4K or even a normal jpg image captured in camera. To increase sharpness with these smaller files I use Topaz Sharpen AI. But the beauty of video is, truly, its story-telling capabilities. Recently I photographed and videoed a Spring Peeper calling, and while I would have been happy with the stills, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I really didn’t convey what I really saw and heard, but the video clips sure did. Editing can seem intimidating, but a good video is a great reward for the effort. I’d been frustrated in trying to decipher books on video editing, and felt there was a real need for an easy-to-follow guide that would take anyone through the important steps. So I wrote one, and you can get it on my website: 25 Key Essential Steps to Making a Great Video with Adobe Premiere CC . 1. Spring Peeper –A and Spring Peeper – B One image is a still shot and the other a still lifted from a video clip taken a few seconds later. Can you tell which one is from the video still? 2. Same question, different pose. Which one is the video capture? 3. Brazilian Tapir. This video capture was from a 4K video clip. 4. Jaguar charge. This video capture was from a slow motion video capture and sharpened with Topaz AI Sharpen. 5. Jaguar charge to caiman. This video capture was from a slow motion video capture and sharpened with Topaz AI Sharpen. Shutter speed was not recorded, but I’m guessing about 1/2000th sec. Answers to Questions 1 Spring Peeper – A is the video capture. Although shot at 1/48th sec., the aperture was f16, so there is a lot of depth of field. The still was shot at f6.3. 2 Spring Peeper – A is the video capture. Both the still and the video capture were shot at the same aperture, f16.

You Can Do Both! ” busey.photography on April 29, 2020 at 8:39 PM said: Thanks for this great content. I just went through a similar thought process and decide to start filming birds more. I thought I would need to get used to missing some would-be-perfect images, but have actually been quite happy so far. With the right shutter speed, the quality of exported frame from video can be very high. I am filming 120fps slow motion bird video a lot these days, but somehow have not tried the 1/250 shutter speed yet. Thanks for the helpful tips and look forward to your new Youtube Channel!

Last night after Stratton Hatfield had picked me up from Nairobi airport we spent the night in a hotel not far from Nairobi NP. This morning we met Joseph Aengwo at the NP gate and with Stratton’s Landrover – our home for the next 6 days - we drove straight into the park. Unfortunately it was raining quite heavily and due to the recent rains the park was generally very wet, which made birding incredibly difficult. So after we ticked Shelley’s Francolin we said goodbye to Nairobi and headed for the Tanzanian border. We ran into some minor setbacks – first a wrong stamp in our passport, then a motorcycle that ran into us and a medication fee for the drivers’ fake injury - but round 13:00 PM we were finally across the border and on our way to Engikaret, better known as the Lark Plains. The plains got their name because they are the only known breeding site for the critically endangered Beesley’s Lark, a charismatic little lark that is down to only 67(!) individuals. At the plains we met Furaha Mbilinyi, a local Arusha birder who would join us for today and tomorrow. This was a great thing for multiple reasons because Furaha doesn’t just know Tanzanian birds and birding sites incredibly well, he is also a fantastic dude to hang around with! After paying a contribution to the local community who watches over the Lark Plains, we started our search for one of the rarest birds in Africa. As we drove out onto the plains the first two new birds we encountered were Greater Kestrel and the stunning Double-banded Courser. It took a while before we found the first larks, but after having fantastic sightings of both Short-tailed Lark and Athi Short-toed Lark we stumbled upon 3 very nice Beesley’s Larks! What a privilege to see these incredibly rare birds in the wild! It is good to see that the community is involved with its conservation and benefits from this species. In my opinion this is the only way to protect this incredibly vulnerable bird. After this success we drove to friends of Stratton – Adrian and Carmen – who had kindly invited us to spend this and the following night at their place. 3000 species! (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 11th MURPHY’S LAW We started our day on a role! As it was just getting light I got my 3000 th species this year, the Rufous-tailed Weaver! The bird following that was even better in my opinion, a stunning Lesser Moorhen, an intra-African migrant that I had missed many times before. We than made short work of Ashy Starling, Yellow-collared Lovebird and best, a Tanzanian Red-billed Hornbill. So far so good, but as we drove back towards Arusha we got our first fine for speeding, well we were doing 40 on a 50 km/h stretch, but lets just say that those Tanzanian cops felt creative today. Around Lake Duluti we found Brown-breasted- and White-eared Barbet, only my second-ever Green-backed Honeybird and the range-restricted Tavetta Golden Weaver. As we drove towards a roadside snack bar for lunch we were almost nailed again by a roadside gang of cops, this time they couldn’t catch us for speeding, but they gave it their best to fine us for not wearing seatbelts on the back seat (meanwhile an open pick-up with two broken mirrors, 12 people and 6 goats passed us with 70 km/h). That lunch was the turning point I guess, since from that point on we were harassed wherever we went. While searching for Lyne’s Cisticola we accidently drove across a dirt road that apparently belonged to some very unfriendly Masaai, instead of helping us to get where we were going they threatened and harassed us until we had no other option than to pay them. On the next road we tried exactly the same thing happened, this time the guy we had paid ran off into a cornfield never to be seen again. By now we seemed to have lost all our momentum and on our way back to Arusha – dipping Hartlaub’s Bustard en route – we were pooled over again. Like last time we had done absolutely nothing wrong, but by some miracle this cop managed to turn our 40 km/h into 60. Tired from all the fines and 50 dollars lighter we drove back to Adrian and Carmen’s place for a well deserved braai, but not before we were pooled over one last time, this time Strattons’ fire-extinguisher had the wrong label on it (I shit you not)… Rufous-tailed Weaver Histurgops ruficaudus (Arjan Dwarshuis) Ashy Starling Lamprotornis unicolor (Arjan Dwarshuis) Taveta Golden Weaver Ploceus castaneiceps (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 12th UP INTO THE USAMBARAS! We left Arusha very early – so we would beat traffic – and headed east towards the Eastern Arc Mountains, our goal was to reach the Western Usambaras by late afternoon. On our way we tried hard for African Finfoot and African Skimmer, but our efforts proved fruitless. What we did find at our 5 th try was the notoriously difficult to find Rock-loving Cisticola. We arrived at Mullers Mountain Lodge in the Western Usambaras around 5 PM and after checking in we raced straight for the famous Sawmill Road, however it was gradually becoming dark and we could only get 3 or 4 specialties before we had to call it a day. Tomorrow we will chase some top-notch birds! May 13th CHASING MEGAS We drove up to the sawmill road when it was still dark, now and then listening for Usambara Nightjar and at our 5 th attempt we hit the jackpot with a calling bird. At the crack of dawn we were on the sawmill road with a very specific target list. By now I’m beginning to run out of species in East Africa so all my targets are pretty much hard to find, rare and endemic birds. We got our first Usambara endemic on the road while driving up, the recently split Usambaru Thrush and as it was slowly getting light we could hear White-breasted Alethes and Spot-throats calling from every direction, seeing them however proved incredibly difficult. We hit the first mega only an hour after arrival when Stratton brilliantly picked up a pair of the rare Usambara Weaver, feeding and calling in the canopy, this bird can often be one of the harder birds to come by in the Western Usambaras. By midday we had notched up most of the targets, but we still had to see a Spot-throat and a White-breasted Alethe and the rarest of them all, the Usambara Akalat, was still lacking from our list. We decided to go off road and straight through the forest, parallel to the road hoping to come across one or two skulkers. Suddenly we simultaneously picked up a movement in the undergrowth, I lifted my bins and there it was, an Usambara Akalat, one of the hardest East African birds to come by. It turned out to be a pair feeding on a small ant swarm. The fact that they were feeding meant that we could even take some reasonable pictures of this rarely photographed species. There were more birds attracted to the antswarm and at one point I had an Akalat, an Usambara Thrush and a Spot-throat in one frame, ridiculous! As you can imagine we savoured our Kilimanjaro beer that evening after cleaning up the Western Usambaras. Usambara Akalat Sheppardia montana (Arjan Dwarshuis) Usambara Thrush Turdus roehli (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 14th FACE TO FACE WITH THE NDUK We left the Western Usambaras early and drove to the Eastern Usambaras, about half a day drive since the last 30 kilometres up to the Amani Forest Camp are on a bad dirt road, to me this only adds to the adventure. We had a warm welcome at the Amani Forest Camp by the very hospitable hosts and as Carl is a chef we enjoyed an outstanding lunch while we scored our first two mega birds right in the garden, Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird and Banded Green Sunbird. After lunch we met our guide John with whom we drove down to a small creek, the apparent stakeout for the near mythical Dappled Mountain Robin. On our way down we saw a Half-collared Kingfisher. Half expecting not to hear or see even a glimpse of the bird I played the tape upon arrival at the site – nobody had seen it here for a long long time – but immediately Stratton heard the bird responding, I however missed the call completely. We waited for a while and I played again, almost immediately two birds zipped right over my head. Stratton got good looks, 100% Dapplethroat, but I only glimpsed it, not remotely enough for a tick. We tried for 3 more hours, but without any luck. We did have great looks at another rare robin, the Sharpe’s Akalat. After this debacle we went in search for another mega rare bird, the Long-billed Tailorbird. Here we had better luck with brief views of a single bird as it skulked through the bamboo. One down! While enjoying an outstanding dinner at the Amani Forest Camp, we suddenly heard a calling Nduk Eagle Owl, the absolute flagship species of the Usambaras. We raced down into the forest, but the bird didn’t call again. John told us that recently a pair proved reliable at the botanical gardens so we drove down there. Just as we opened the door of our car we heard the bizarre call of an Nduk Eagle Owl somewhere in the canopy next to the road, in the distance another bird responded. Now we had a problem, the bird was somewhere high up in the canopy, completely hidden from sight and despite shining our torch from multiple different angles, we just couldn’t see it. Suddenly some dogs started barking on the premises where we were standing on, which apparently spooked the bird. It flew to another tree and there we finally got amazing views. What a fantastic bird, definitely one of the absolute East African highlights this year! Unidentified frog (Arjan Dwarshuis) Unidentified frog (Arjan Dwarshuis) East Usambaras (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 15th RUNNING OUT OF NEW BIRDS We had done incredibly well yesterday, which meant that there were just three birds left to find for us in the Usambaras, the Dapple-throat, the Kretschmer’s Longbill and the Usambara Hyliota. We tried the full morning for the Dapple-throat, but it never called, let alone showed again. Our search for the Longbill eventually paid off, but it took more than two hours of off-trail hiking up and down hillsides before we finally got it. The whole afternoon we focussed on the Hyliota in a forest patch at 400 meters altitude, but despite our efforts we had no success. Despite a full day grinding through the forests of the Usambaras we only got three new species, than you know it is time to move :( May 16th GOODBYE TANZANIA! We spent the whole morning looking for the Hyliota, but at 9 AM we had to reluctantly end our search since I had a flight to catch to Antananarivo! Joseph, Stratton and me had a lot of fun on our last drive together this year, back to Arusha, but despite several stops we just couldn’t find a single new species and by the time I reached the airport it became clear that this was my first 0 species day… Tomorrow I’ll be in Madagascar where everything will be new! Thanks Stratton and Joseph for these awesome seven days. We had to work hard for new species, but we did get some incredibly rare ones!

And it makes sense: action shots are more engaging than static images, and the action of flight is the one thing that most expresses what it is to be a bird. So not surprisingly, within the world of wildlife photographers, Birds in Flight – or “BIF” – is a particular specialty with its own unique skill set. Short-billed Dowitcher. 500mm,  f/7.1, 1/2000 sec, ISO 800. Capturing great images of a birds in flight requires patience, skill, and judgement. I don’t claim to be anywhere close to having mastered this particular aspect of photography, but I have learned a few things along the way. Consider this a beginners’ guide to BIF. Birds in Flight – What makes a Great Image? Technical qualities . Needless to say, as with any great image, a BIF photo should show crisp focus, proper exposure, and enough depth of field so that the whole bird is in focus Activity . An image of a bird in its element is good enough, but it will be more engaging if the bird is doing something recognizable – carrying prey or nesting material, taking off or coming in for a landing, feeding, engaging with other birds, etc. Composition . As a general rule the bird should be: Flying towards the photographer or seen from a side view. The rear end view of a bird flying away is rarely interesting. Looking towards the viewer. For the best results the focus point should be on the nearest eye. Captured with its wings and legs held in an attractive manner. And be sure you leave some space in front of a flying bird. The image will look a bit claustrophobic if the bird  does not have room to fly. Background . A bird against a featureless white or blue sky is not as engaging as it would be with a more visually interesting background – glimpses of its habitat, for example a Northern Harrier over grassland or a Red-shouldered Hawk flying amongst the trees, or failing that at least some interesting clouds. Books, social media posts, and blogs on photography tend to slavishly favour the convention that the background should be out of focus lest it detract attention from the subject . This is actually a stylistic choice not a rule, and you should feel free to ignore it in favour of your own personal vision. Blue-footed Booby. 300mm, f/8.0, 1/1250 sec, ISO 400 Feral Pigeons at Dough Fluhrer Park. 200mm, f/7.1, 1/1600 sec, ISO 160. Approach The really great photographs of birds in flight that you have seen in exhibitions and magazines are almost certainly products of a deliberate approach to photography. What I mean by that is that the photographer set out that day aiming to get a particular image. They planned the shoot, considering the light conditions they were looking for, the best background, and where the birds could most advantageously be seen.  Thus preparation put them in the best position to get what they were looking for. That approach does not fit in well with the normal activities of birding, which usually comprise walking around and seeing the birds as they make themselves available. However there can be good opportunities on a bird walk, particularly in open country, if you adjust your camera up in advance with the settings you would need for a BIF opportunity. Almost all of the images in this article were captured while out birding. And sometimes you can just get lucky. I am quite pleased with the Red-rumped Bush Tyrant image which came about because on a really bright day I had dialed in a fast shutter speed just to avoid overexposure. :Red-rumped Bush Tyrant. 500mm,  f/5.6, 1/1000 sec, ISO 900. Red-tailed Hawk. 500mm, f/7.1, 1/1600 sec, ISO 400. Settings The most important setting you will need to adopt for shooting birds in flight is a much faster shutter speed than you normally use. Even birds like swans or herons that appear to be slow and ponderous are actually moving quite quickly. For example, as a Mute Swan flies by, its slow cruise speed of 30kph equates to almost nine metres per second –  for a bird that is about a 1.5 metres long. Combined with the imperfect movement of your lens as you try to track the bird, at a normal shutter speed the resulting shot will be tend to be blurry, or at least not as sharp as you would want. So if you want to freeze the action and get a crisp shot you need a high shutter speed. How high? There are two answers: It depends on the bird – what it is doing, how close it is, whether it is heading towards you or across your field of vision. Experience will be your best guide in judging how fast the shutter needs to be. But if in doubt, faster is always better. Shutter Speed Guidelines for Birds in Flight I reviewed a lot of my own BIF images when researching this article and one thing I noticed is that most of the ones I like were taken at a shutter speed of 1/1600 or higher. For large, slow-flying or soaring birds (Canada Goose, Red-tailed Hawk) you might get away with a lower speed, particularly if the bird is in a slower phase of movement. The White-faced Ibis below is gliding in for a landing. In this case 1/800 was fast enough to catch the bird and even the water droplets falling off of it but it’s the exception rather than the rule. 1/1600 is better as a baseline – it will improve the number of “keepers” in a shooting session. White-faced Ibis at Erieau ON. 500mm, f/6.3, 1/800 sec, ISO 250. American White Pelican. 500mm, f/5.6, 1/2000 sec, ISO 1000. Note that the closer you are to the bird the faster it will cross through your field of vision, so an even higher speed may be needed. For smaller and/or faster-moving birds the need for speed increases. Each situation is different but as a starting point I would suggest the following minimum speeds: Gulls and other medium-sized birds – 1/2000 Swallows, martins and small passerines (e.g. flycatchers, chickadees etc) – start at 1/3200 and be prepared to go up from there, especially if the bird is flying towards you. Hummingbirds – these are a special case. When they are hovering, the best images often show a fair amount of blur of the wings while the body remains stationary (and thus in sharp focus). The blur gives the impression of how fast their wingbeat really is – up to 80 beats per second. Bank Swallow. 500mm, f/6.3, 1/3200 sec, ISO 500. Sapphire-spangled Emerald. 500mm, f/5.6, 1/1250 sec, ISO 4000. Technique Even the fastest shutter speed won’t guarantee a good image. You also need to be able to track the bird closely enough that your autofocus can achieve a lock. Modern cameras have fairly advanced abilities to achieve and maintain focus lock on a moving target, but you can help things out by developing and practicing good habits. Tracking . When you are photographing a series of birds flying across your field of vision, the natural tendency is to aim at a bird as it approaches and then try to twist your body to track it along its line of flight. More experienced BIF photographers decide where they want the bird to be when they take the shot, considering background and proximity, and set there feet so that when the bird hits that point it is straight in front of them. This gives them the greatest control at the critical moment. They then wind their torso left or right to the point where the bird will first appear. It’s a simple trick but it works. The image at the top of the page was shot using this method. A series of Short-billed Dowitchers were flying across a lagoon so it was possible to predict their movement and be set up for the side-on flight shot. Burst Mode . Even the best autofocus system will struggle to keep a moving target constantly in sharp focus. There will always be moments when the focus wanders a bit before the system corrects itself. You can help ensure you come away with some sharp images by firing bursts rather than single frames. To do this, set your shutter release mode to Continuous Low or Continuous High and hold the shutter release down when the bird enters your target zone. A side benefit of firing bursts is that it also gives you a better chance of acquiring an image where the bird is doing what you want it to do – looking towards you, holding its wings in a graceful manner, etc. Note the  series of unprocessed images of an Andean Gull below. This short burst took less than one second but you can see the variety of shapes and wing positions during that span. Longer bursts increase the chances of getting the shot you really want. Andean Gulls Environment . You can also use the wind to your advantage. All else being equal a bird flying into a headwind will be moving more slowly relative to the ground observer and thus easier to track. Light The use of fast shutter speeds significantly reduces the amount of light that reaches the camera’s sensor. In practice this means that BIF photography in low-light conditions will necessitate high ISO values with the attendant problem of excessive noise. The best results tend to come when there is full daylight but without the harsh glare of the midday sun. Days that are brightly-lit but overcast can provide excellent conditions as overly-bright highlights will be less of a problem, but in this case you will want to have something in the background other than a pale grey sky. And if you are shooting upwards on a bright day, for example at a soaring raptor, remember that exposure compensation is your friend. Increasing your exposure by a stop or two will avoid the dreaded underwing shadow and help you bring out the colour and detail of the bird’s undersides. Equipment In most situations all you need to start experimenting with birds in flight photography is the camera you already have (DSLR or mirrorless) and a telephoto lens. For close range work, for example chickadees at Lemoine Point, a shorter telephoto in the 200mm range will work, otherwise you should look for a lens of at least 300mm. My article on the September Blue Bill identified some good choices at various price levels. The only caveat is that if you start to shoot in long bursts you may need to upgrade to a faster memory card. If you become really enthusiastic about BIF then you may eventually want to look at a tripod with a gimbal mount. I may eventually head in this direction, but at the moment I almost exclusively hand-hold my cameras so I am not in a position to recommend specific options. Practice Like any other photography skill your ability to photograph birds in flight will improve with practice. Fortunately you don’t have to go far afield to work on your skills – nature has provided us with an ample supply of gulls, feral pigeons and Mallards that are abundant, easily found, and not too afraid of people. They are great subjects to work with as you start out on your BIF journey. Good shooting! …and if you find all of this too easy, and you really want to drive yourself mad, there’s always IIF – insects in flight. 😊 Forster’s Tern. 500mm, f/6.3, 1/2500 sec, ISO 400.

The trip contained moments of transcendent beauty and some truly grim events, but it was never boring. And yes, there were a few birds along the way! I will spare you a blow-by-blow account of a trip that, with travel time, lasted most of a month. But here are a few highlights. Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego Magellanic Woodpecker The company assembled in Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. We were travelling with British touring company Birdquest so there was no quiet settling-in period. On the first morning we had a rather strenuous hike up Garibaldi Pass, but successfully achieved the aim of nabbing the highly-desirable White-bellied Seedsnipe. In the following days we roamed through beautiful parks, shoreline, and the municipal dump, along the way getting cracking close-up views of Tierra del Fuego’s star bird – the Magellanic Woodpecker – along with most of the other endemic and local species. The final pre-boarding day saw us hop aboard a small boat for a cruise of the outer islands. A three-hour cruise . Thorn-tailed Rayadito Upland Goose Yellow-bridled Finch White-bellied Seedsnipe We also caught our first glimpse of our home for the next two weeks – the MV Plancius. Formerly a research vessel for the Royal Netherlands Navy, Plancius had been converted to expedition duties. It was amusing and mildly alarming to see this small 105-pax vessel, hidden as it was amongst much larger cruise ships, but we had been assured that its diminutive size allowed it to get into smaller anchorages than the big boys. This proved to be true, though there were other implications of its size that would become clear in time. Plancius is the dark blue one to the right of the big boys. Falklands Part 1 Finally we set sail through the Beagle Channel headed for the Falkland Islands. For me this was terra incognita. My compañeros had both visited the place at the behest of her Majesty, but I got the distinct impression that work had significantly interfered with these birding holidays. Zodiacs were used to transport us to the landings. Inger Vandyke and Andrew Harrison compare notes. After a pleasant day on the back deck getting acquainted with seabirds we made landfall, visiting Grave Cove and West Point Island in West Falkland. Gentoo and Southern Rockhopper Penguins were on their nests, as were masses of Black-browed Albatrosses, and a handful of Magellanic Penguins emerged from their burrows to inspect us. Gentoo Penguin Black-browed Albatross Striated Caracara, a.k.a. Johnny Rook Magellanic Penguin It was an excellent day, though the increasingly stiff wind should have been a clue that all might not be well. And sure enough, as we transited the islands headed for Port Stanley those winds increased to seven on the Beaufort Scale and it emerged that we would be unable to dock at Stanley as the port was closed. Somewhat disappointed, we pushed on through high seas and strong winds on our way to South Georgia. Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main Three full days of seawatching ensued. Along the way we crossed over the Antarctic Convergence and the air temperature dropped significantly, but the hardcore birders still kept watch from the deck while more timid passengers huddled in the lounge. Northern Royal Albatross As we sailed through the Roaring Forties and on into the Furious Fifties another aspect of the Plancius’s size manifested itself. She definitely was bounced around by the wind and seas, and displayed a strong tendency to roll. With our bunks oriented at 90 degrees to the ship’s axis this introduced the novel experience of falling asleep whilst continuously sliding from one end of the bed to the other! But one adapts. Birders at the office. South Georgia Prince Olav Harbour whaling station. Finally we arrived, but the wind that had plagued us was not prepared to relent. Gusts of 40-50 knots  meant that our first planned landing in Prince Olav Harbour was converted into a zodiac cruise. We were next due to visit the King Penguin colony on Salisbury Plain. Conditions remained unfavourable so we did some scenic cruising along the coast, but finally the wind relented and we were deposited on a long sand beach with no one to keep us company but a couple of hundred seals and around 200,000 King Penguins. Salisbury Plain We had been warned not to approach within 5 metres of the penguins, but the penguins evidently did not get that memo. They were extremely interested in these novel creatures that had entered their domain, and despite evident disappointment on discovering that we were not edible, they continued to observe us closely. Let’s go meet the new neighbours! This became the pattern for the next few days: sail around a bit, boat into shore, commune with penguins and seals, and move on again. King, Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Macaroni Penguins each had their turn in the starring role, with a strong supporting cast of skuas, petrels, shags, terns and the perky South Georgia Pipit. Elephant Seals! The little black 50kg items are the babies. Gold Harbour. Me and my new friend. Photo by Inger Vandyke. Macaroni Penguins We did make the obligatory stop at Grytviken to view the rusting remains of a massive whale-processing facility that was the final resting place of 175,000 whales and countless seals. And needless to say a fine dram was hoisted at the grave of the master mariner Sir Ernest Shackleton. M/V Plancius and friend, Grytviken Harbour. A small section of the abandoned whale oil processing facility. South towards Antarctica… Too soon our time among the spectacular wildlife of South Georgia came to an end and in high spirits we turned south for the three-day run down to the South Orkney Islands and the Weddell Sea. We were now crossing into the Screaming Sixties, and learning that the seas there truly earned their name. In the teeth of a proper gale – Force 9 and 30-metre swells – the mighty Plancius crawled southwards at a true speed of about seven knots. Sadly, seawatching was curtailed as the decks were made off limits to passengers. On the first night outbound tragedy struck. A fellow passenger had a fall and badly injured his head. Suddenly plans had to change. Antarctica was no longer on the programme as we turned around and headed back to the nearest medical facilities at Port Stanley – three long days away. The ship’s doctor and medical professionals amongst the passengers did their best for the casualty, but after about 24 hours he succumbed to his injuries. We later learned that he was one of three passengers killed on Antarctic cruises that season. Falklands Part 2 Being obliged to continue on to Stanley so the Coroner could conduct an investigation, we were able to see the birds of the East Falklands that we had missed on the first go-around. After a morale-building round of fish and chips at the Victory Bar. A thorough search was conducted. Southern Rockhopper Penguin, KIdney Cove. White-tufted Grebes, East Falkland. Blackish Oystercatcher, New Island. Magellanic Penguins, Saunders Island. We were also able to fit in a few more birdy islands in West Falkland on the way home, inter alia bagging the endemic Cobb’s Wren. Cobb’s Wren, Carcass Island. And just to show that the weather gods have a sense of humour, we had calm seas and warm winds all the way back to Ushuaia. Anthony, Andrew, and Geoffrey. Ezeiza The story would not be complete without a shout-out to this leafy suburb of Buenos Aires close by the airport. Or more properly to the birds therein. I found a handful of new life birds while overnighting on the way down and back, including the remarkably odd Guira Cuckoo. Guira Cuckoo Picazuro Pigeon Chalk-browed Mockingbird Epilogue This was, quite possibly, the trip of a lifetime. The wildlife spectacle of South Georgia is equalled only by the great migration on the Serengeti plains. Add in the remoteness, the arduous conditions, and the limited number of people willing and able to make the trip and it becomes something truly special. Are we sad to have missed standing on the Antarctic continent? Definitely. Are we likely to take another month of our lives and another big pile of cash to do a regain? Flat no to that. Would we recommend it to others? Yes, strongly. But with a quiet talk about the actual risks and the physical requirements to navigate one’s way around a rolling ship a long way from help.

Obviously it was a good day in its own rights, but there was something very satisfying about that nice round milestone number. As there was when I saw my 500 th bird species, my thousandth, and so on. So when 2022 started to look like the year of the great pushback after endless lockdowns, I began to wonder whether it might be possible to hit another milestone: to see 1000 birds in a year. In global birding terms this is not exactly a stretch goal: people have seen as many as 6833 species in a year, but they were younger, and either richer, intending to get richer by self-promotion, heavily sponsored, or all of the above. [i] But for an ordinary bloke of ordinary means, and with 65 years on the odometer, 1000 seemed like a tough but not totally implausible goal. And if it could be done, 2022 looked like the year to do it. The combination of trips long-planned and trips cancelled and rescheduled multiple times due to the pesky virus might just put the number 1000 in play. Can I be one of the immortal 1000?  Rufous-crested Coquette, Waqanki Lodge, Peru, 20 July. 1000 birds – the theory So I checked my records and some trip reports. A decent year in Ontario, allowing for time spent out of the country but no rarity-chasing, should be about 230. Santa Marta Ecuador and La Guajira in Colombia should be good for 250 or so, though with a certain amount of overlap (boreal migrants seen in their wintering grounds and then seen again in Ontario). Ecuador was bound to be good, but how many of those species would be overlaps with Colombia? Birdquest was regularly reporting 600+ species in northern Peru. But with trip reports by bird tour companies, you always have to ask whether that was 600 seen/heard by the guide or a realistic 600? And again, how many of those would be overlaps with Ecuador? The South Atlantic would be epic but there were only about 60-80 species to be had. (Albeit great ones such as my first penguins outside of a zoo). But when I added up the conservative estimates it looked like 1000 was do-able. If all went well… 1000 birds – the execution Which of course it didn’t. Omicron put paid to the January expedition to Colombia, and severely restricted my efforts to get the desired winter birds in Ontario. So no Lapland Longspurs, no Northern Saw-whet Owls, and no Northern Shrikes were seen, though fortunately we were able to get to Algonquin Park in February and notch all the finch specialties as well as the wily and elusive Black-backed Woodpecker. White-winged Crossbill absconds with a prize. Algonquin Provincial Park, 18 Feb 22. Ecuador In March I was off to terra incognita, in the form of Southwest Ecuador . Ecuador is, of course, on my to-do list, but the timing of this particular voyage allowed me to avoid losing a deposit from a cancelled trip. We certainly saw some spectacular bird species including the star of the show, the Jocotoco Antpitta, but the sub-optimal aspect from a 1000-in-a-year perspective is that the Tumbes dry forest ecosystem which is the big attraction of Southwest Ecuador would also feature largely in the Northern Peru trip (about which more later). Jocotoco Antpitta. Reserva Tapichalaca, Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador, 8 March 22. Travel was possible in March but it was still in the era of heavy Covid protocols, so I had to stay two extra days in Quito to ensure I had a negative PCR test. On the plus side this allowed me to book two day trips. At the Antisana volcano on the first day I managed to see the final one of my three essential South American birds: the iconic and incomparable Andean Condor. It’s just the largest bird of prey in the world, the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight (15kg) and wingspan (3.3metres), able to soar for hours without a single flap of its mighty wings (five hours and over 100 miles without a wing flap in one recent study), roosts and breed at elevations of 3,000 to 5,000 m, … I could go on, but you get the picture. One was pleased. Andean Condor. Reserva Antisana, Ecuador, 12 March 22. Reserva Antisana, with Gabriel Bucheli. Masks were still required on the public footpaths. Back to Ontario A week in Pelee in May helped to tick off most of the usual suspects for Ontario, and even added a couple of life birds (Worm-eating Warbler and White-faced Ibis). The fact that the week turned into a week and a half due to a painfully expensive car repair shall go unmentioned. Acadian Flycatcher, Point Pelee National Park, 11 May 22. White-faced Ibis, Erieau Ontario, 4 May 22. The rest of May and most of June were devoted to working on the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas, so June added a whopping total of four birds to my year list. Peru And then it was July and Northern Peru. My plan had been to work my way down to Peru at some future date, but here again I needed to use up a deposit and by that time we knew enough about the Covid pest to guess that July and August were the months least likely to be feature an outbreak. Birding in the high Andes. Peru was a bit of a slog. An extended trip coupled with the fact that it takes a long time to get there and back meant that I was away from 9 July to 2 August. And there was a lot of marching up and down the hill involved. But it was eminently worth the pain – epic birds in epic numbers in epic scenery. I will save the details for a future post. Cinnamon Screech Owl, Abra Patricia, 17 July 22. Gilded Barbet, ACR Cordillera Escalera, San Martín Province, Peru, 25 Jul 22. August was essentially a non-birding month as I tried to wade through 3000 images from Peru. The only additions to the list were a Loggerhead Shrike on the Napanee Alvar (on the fourth attempt!), plus Grasshopper Sparrow and a Yellow-billed Cuckoo with the North Leeds Birders on Amherst Island. Moosonee September brought along another trip cancelled and rescheduled multiple time: Moosonee and Moose Factory with the Ontario Field Ornithologists. This trip was more about riding the Polar Bear Express and seeing the far north of Ontario than it was about year listing, but to my surprise I did get some very nice additions including LeConte’s Sparrow and Red-necked Phalarope, nabbed a Canvasback to make up for the ones I missed in March by being out of the country, and had a close encounter with my nemesis bird, the Fox Sparrow. Rusty Blackbird in its element. Moosonee Sewage Lagoons, 13 September 22. The Polar Bear Express. Then list went quiet for October. The time at home with Lynn balance needed some reinvestment and I had committed to spending two weeks working for the man. I also needed time to plan for and obsess about the biggest trip of all: Tierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Antarctica. The South Atlantic Odyssey This scheme had been cooked up with old muckers Geoffrey McMullan and Andrew Harrison of the Army Ornithological Society. The extended timeline between booking a place and going on the trip neatly bookended the Covid interlude, and it came to pass that we went, we saw penguins, we returned. It was an amazing wildlife experience which I will eventually write up as a blog post, and it also effectively ended the year of the 1000 bird goal. The only addition before ENDEX was a Tundra Swan seen with Rick Lott and Grant Kaduck on the Kingston Christmas Bird Count. Magellanic Woodpecker. Tierra del Fuego National Park, 21 Nov 22. Magellanic Penguins on the march. Falkland Islands, 8 December 22. So, you might observe, Kaduck has been avoiding the elephant in the room. Did I actually get to 1000 bird species in 2022? 1000 birds? – the results please Well yes. 1121 to be precise, and that’s on the restrictive ebird/Clements taxonomy. So yay for me. 😊 The circumstances of 2022 were unique, so the likelihood of hitting 1000 again seems small. But I’m chalking it up as once of those things, like running a marathon or jumping out of an airplane, that I have experienced and don’t need to aim for again. Granted, a major lottery win might change that perspective, but since I don’t buy lottery tickets the contingency, as Jeeves would say, is remote. Bird #1000 – White-tailed Shrike Tyrant, 29 July 22.

I was excited and a bit afraid of the task at hand. I had to find my way across a city with 14 million inhabitants to my hotel, the Capsule Inn. That\\'s right, I was sleeping in a capsule tonight. You see, booking an overnight stay in downtown Tokyo during the holidays can be terribly expensive, unless you are prepared to sleep in a 2 m2 room. Luckily, using the Tokyo public transportation system proved much easier than expected. All metro and train stations are named in English and everything is color-coded, making Tokyo actually the easiest mega-city to get around! I arrived at the Capsule Inn around 9 PM and after a fantastic Japanese dinner I went to bed. Four hours later I was awake again thanks to my jetlag and lying awake in a capsule for four hours is not the best feeling in the world ... At 6:30 the alarm went off and my ordeal was over! I had breakfast and took a metro to Yoyogi Station, where I was met by Chris Cook, my guide for today. Together we walked to Yoyogi Park where we started birding. My two main targets were quickly found, the Varied Tit and Japanese Pygmy-woodpecker. Pale and Dusky Thrushes were feeding on the parks open fields and we found a nice flock of wintering Mandarin Ducks on a small pond. From Yoyogi Station we took the metro to Kasai Rinkai Koen at the other side of Tokyo, which is situated at Tokyo Bay. We found out that we were not the only birders out birding with Christmas. There were literally hundreds of photographers and birders in Kasai Rinkai Park! Great to see that birding is hot and happening in Japan! We did find some great birds here, best of the bunch being the gulls. Kamchatca, Black-tailed, Vega and Slaty-backed Gull were all seen and a real bonus was an adult Saunders\\'s Gull found by Chris. Another unexpected find were two Black-faced Spoonbills. At noon I said goodbye to Chris and finished the day birding till dusk before I took a metro to the airport, where I boarded my flight to Taipei, Taiwan .

Together we drove to the Dasyueshan Forest where we checked in at our hotel for a couple of hours of sleep. As soon as it was light enough we started birding, initially focusing on the lower part of the mountain range. As always on an island with a good number of endemics, new species kept rolling in during these first couple of hours of birding. Highlights were Yellow Tit, Taiwan Hwamei, Steere\\'s Liocichla and a wintering - and calling - Kamchatka Leaf-warbler, a recent split from the Arctic Warbler-complex. A little bit higher up the mountain we had no trouble finding the beautiful Swinhoe\\'s Pheasant and Taiwan Whistling-Thrush and Taiwan Wren-babbler where the only ones for the trip. In the afternoon we drove up a road with one of the best scenery\\'s I encountered this whole year. It is great to see that Taiwan\\'s Mountains are still covered in extensive forest. Another great thing was that we encountered hundreds of local birdwatchers and especially photographers looking for Taiwan\\'s sought after endemic birds. After my experience in Japan it became clear to me that birding and photography is booming in East Asia! At the highest part of the Dasyueshan road we found the sought after Collared Bush-robin and Flamecrest, but I was especially pleased with Taiwan Fulvetta and Taiwan Rosefinch. Quite interesting were local forms of White-backed Woodpecker, Eurasian Wren and Eurasian Nutcracker. The star bird - Mikado Pheasant - however did not show itself at its usual stakeout. Swinhoe\\'s Pheasant Lophura swinhoii (Arjan Dwarshuis) White-whiskered Laughingthrush Garrulax cineraceus (Arjan Dwarshuis) Taiwanese mountains (Arjan Dwarshuis) December 27th CHASNG TAIWAN ENDEMICS We had done pretty well yesterday which meant that today would of course be a little bit more challenging. We started our quest for the remaining Taiwan endemic where we\\'d left off, in the mountains. Here we quickly found our first target, a covey of Taiwan Partridges. We tried without success for the elusive Rusty Laugingthrush before we headed downhill to look for Taiwan Blue Magpie and Chestnut-bellied Tit in a different valley. During our first stop we found the Magpie and after a bit of searching we managed to get fantastic looks at the tit. In the late afternoon we went up into the mountains one last time to try for Mikado Pheasant, but again this fantastic species refused to show itself; quite a painful dip as you can imagine.

Whites Thrush Zoothera aurea (top) and Scaly Thrush Zoothera dauma (bottom) (Arjan Dwarshuis) December 28th STUCK AT TAIPEI AIRPORT Around 7:30 AM Richard dropped me off at Taipei Airport. I was ready to check in for my flight to Vietnam when I found out that my visa was not in order. It would take at least five hours to fix this, so of course I missed my flight. I had to spend the whole day on Taipei airport before I could finally get on a new flight to Ho Chi Min City, which left at 7 PM. I made a whole lot of extra unnecessary costs and arrived in Vietnam just before midnight. Of course I did not see any new species today. I guess it had to happen at some point, so better all the way at the tail end of my Biggest Year. December 29th VIETNAM, MY LAST COUNTRY THIS YEAR! Last night I was picked up from Ho Chi Min Airport by my guide - Phuc Le - for the remaining three days of my Biggest Year in Vietnam. This beautiful country has always been high on my whish list, not just for its impressive list of endemics and other special birds, but also for the great food and the friendly people. Phuc and I drove four hours to Cat Tien National Park where arrived around 2:30 AM. This gave me just enough time for a couple of hours of much needed sleep. After a quick noodle soup breakfast it was time to start birding. Phuc decided that we would first head off to the grasslands to look for the endangered Green Peafowl which is arguably the most beautiful of all pheasants. During the walk to the grasslands we found Golden-crested Myna\\'s, Grey-faced Tit-babbler and Grey-headed Parakeet. In the grasslands it took a bit of searching, but eventually we found two stunning Green Peafowls. Around midday bird activity stopped so I decided to take a well-deserved afternoon nap. In the afternoon we went after the two species of Pitta that can be found in the park. We got splendid views of Bar-bellied Pitta, but Blue-rumped Pitta unfortunately was only heard. Green Peafowl Pavo muticus (Arjan Dwarshuis) Bar-bellied Pitta Pitta elliotii (Arjan Dwarshuis) December 30th ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE EVERYTHING WORKS You have some of those days where everything works perfectly, today turned out to be such a day. It already started great with an amazing dawn chorus of a family of Red-cheeked Gibbons. Half an hour later we took a jeep ride to Crocodile Lake. Shortly after our arrival two Germain\\'s Peacock-Pheasants started calling and after some playback of their calls I actually got to see one really well as it crept across the forest floor. 15 Minutes later we were looking at a family of three Dusky Broadbills, but the best sighting of the morning was still to come. Totally unexpected we bumped into a small covey of the rare Orange-necked Partridge, which is probably the hardest specialty to find in the whole park. Great stuff. After packing our bags we commenced with the 2,5 hour drive to Nui San Pass, a birding site half way between Cat Tien and Dalat. When we arrived at Nui San Pass it was around 2:30 PM and there was absolutely zero bird activity. That\\'s the beauty of birding, out of the blue things can change dramatically. Suddenly we heard a huge flock of birds approaching through the forest and moments later we were seeing dozens of Black-capped Parrotbills, Black-hooded Laughingthrushes, Red-billed Scimitar-babbler and to top things off several Vietnamese Cutias, Yellow-billed Nuthatches and two Indochinese Green Magpies. At the top we focused on the rare and notoriously skulking Orange-breasted Laughingthrush and after playing hide-and-seek with this bird for half an hour I had fantastic looks at one. When it became dark we continued to Dalat. Here we met up for some beers with Tjeerd Burger, André Willem Faber and Jaap Hennevanger. These three Dutch birders would join us tomorrow for the last day of my Biggest Year!

Today was a special day, the last one of my Biggest Year that is! Unfortunately it was raining cats-and-dogs when we left Dalat town. I was telling Tjeerd, Jaap and Adre that this was about the worst weather I endured this entire year. ‘What?! THIS is the worst weather you’ve had ALL YEAR?!’ Indeed I have been incredibly lucky this year. Not just with the weather, but also with flights, political situations and my health; I haven’t been sick for a single day! That alone is crazy, normally I get sick at least once or twice a year. I guess being out and about and doing the thing you love all day is generally good for your health. Also it probably helped that I never drank more than one or two beers a day, making sure I was fresh the next day, both physically and mentally. We had three challenging target birds this last day of the year. The Grey-crowned Crocias, Collared Laughingthrush and Black-crowned Fulvetta. All three are endemic to Vietnam, all three are rare and all three are beautiful. We spent the first three hours of day looking for the laughingthrush, but all we got was wet to the bone. Later in the morning we connected with our first – and my personally most wanted – target, the unique and endangered Grey-crowned Crocias. We found at least two birds moving with a big mixed species flock that also contained Vietnamese Cutias and the Grey-crowned Bush-tit, a likely future split from, Black-throated Bush-tit. Due to the horrendous weather I couldn’t take out my camera all day, so no photos of this beauty unfortunately. Another good bird this morning was the endemic Vietnamese Greenfinch, as well as the range-restricted Slender-billed Oriole. In the afternoon we drove two hours to Bidoup NP, the last birding site for me this year. You could see the effects of the heavy rain. The river had swallowed entire coffee plantations, houses and unfortunately for us, also the trail system in the park. We tried crossing a newly formed stream bare foot, only to find out that there was an even bigger and faster flowing stream two hundred meters ahead. After freeing a Vietnamese family whose car got stuck on the muddy road, we decided it was probably best to focus our energy to the roadside for the last half hour of daylight. Here that last bit of Biggest Year-magic happened. With only 20 minutes of daylight left I suddenly heard a Collared Laughingthrush responding in the distance. We managed to get closer to the bird and ten minutes later we all got views of this incredibly good looking and endangered Laughingthrush that skulked through the undergrowth. We walked back to the car, having given up on the fulvetta, but Phuc decided to play the song of the bird one last time and behold, we got a response! While it was slowly becoming too dark to bird we had fantastic views of my last possible Vietnamese endemic this year. After dinner, a quick powernap and a shower, we headed into Dalat town for my first and last day of boozing this whole year! Cheers! It was an incredible year! I will soon post an epilogue of my Biggest Year.

When Arjan Dwarshuis first heard of the “Big Year”—the legendary record for birdwatching—he was twenty years old, it was midnight, and he was sitting on the roof of a truck in the Andean Mountains. In that moment he promised himself that, someday, somehow, he would become a world-record-holding birder. Ten years later, he embarked on an incredible, arduous, and perilous journey that took him around the globe; over uninhabited islands, through dense unforgiving rainforests, across snowy mountain peaks and unrelenting deserts—in just a single year. Would he survive? Would he be able to break the “Big Year” record, navigating through a world filled with shifting climate and geopolitical challenges? The (Big) Year that Flew By is an unforgettable, personal exploration of the limits of human potential when engaging with the natural world. It is a book about birds and birding and Arjan’s attempts to raise awareness for critically endangered species, but it is also a book about overcoming mental challenges, extreme physical danger, and human competition and fully realizing your passions through nature, adventure, and conservation. “Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.” ― Booklist “I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” —The Washington Post Reviews and Praise “Dutch birders take their pursuit to a higher plane of skill and intensity, as exemplified in this global trek by Arjan Dwarshuis. A fast-paced page-turner and a unique adventure story, The (Big) Year that Flew By is also filled with insights about landscapes, people, and a world of wonderful birds.” —Kenn Kaufman, author of Kingbird Highway More Reviews and Praise “Arjan artistically weaves together the beauty of the birds, the importance of conservation, and the complex logistics of non-stop travel. The roller coaster highs of seeing a target bird, paired with the lows of absolute fatigue and exhaustion, are an innate undertone of any birder’s big year.” —Tiffany Kersten, birding guide and continental U.S. Big Year record holder “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is not simply a celebration of a broken record but a global call to action to protect the habitats that birds rely on for survival. A Big Year of birding is a massive undertaking, requiring a Herculean effort to successfully plan and execute. While this quest involves daunting logistics and emotional hurdles, the most notable achievement is distilling so much lived experience into a single book. Arjan has conquered both, beautifully capturing\\xa0remote wild places and conveying the\\xa0intensity endured to find and observe nearly three-quarters of the world’s bird species. Arjan’s contagious passion for birds infuses his account of a global avian scavenger hunt like no other.” —Christian Hagenlocher, author of the Falcon Freeway “An astonishing achievement! Arjan Dwarshuis’s\\xa0year\\xa0was so\\xa0big\\xa0it covered an entire planet. His eagle eyes took in almost 7,000 species of bird and brought into sharp focus their often-fragile existence. Dwarshuis’s heartfelt prose reminds us that many of these species are living on the edge—just a generation or two away from extinction. Yet this is a story of hope—Dwarshuis shines a light on the many communities around the world banding together to save their local birdlife. This book is a glorious tribute to the wealth of beauty and diversity found in birds, and a clarion call for us all to care about the future of birds everywhere. “ —Neil Hayward, author of Lost Among the B irds “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is somehow both a fast-paced race through and an in-depth immersion in an amazing birding big year. Arjan Dwarshuis does an excellent job of portraying the excitement, stress, and exertion that are part of any Big Year, but that was even more so in his record-breaking worldwide Big Year. I very much enjoyed reading his account, sometimes with my heart pounding, as I lived his journey with him, feeling joy when he managed to find another rarity, concern with his bird-seeking struggles, and sorrow in his very rare misses. As I read, I continued to be impressed by the logistics required for all his travels, and by the excellent people who helped him find all these bird species. His interspersing of tales of his early birding years helped me better understand the how and why he was able to pull off his remarkable feat as well as his passion for birding. Throughout this book, he also explained conservation concerns and advances as they relate to the birds he sought, providing words of wisdom and words of hope. In his conclusion, he admits that while flying all over the world does use much energy, ecotourism in many far-flung places has been and continues to be of great importance in saving birds and habitats. I especially appreciate his conclusion in which he asks his readers to adopt a positive attitude and do their part—\\'enjoy nature and look up to the sky.’” —Lynn Barber, author of Extreme Birder “Arjan’s story is brilliantly told. I was with him every step of the way. It is much more than just a story about one man’s bid to see as most of the world’s bird species in one year as humanly possible. No, this is an epic journey by a man who’s not only obsessed with birds but who has a deep spiritual connection with the planet as he observes the environments and habitats he encounters. It is clear that we have to do more to take care of our world and all its inhabitants, including us.” —David Lindo, author of How to be an Urban Birder \"[An] entertaining debut . . . . [that] offers colorful glimpses into the locales the author visits. . . . Part birding journal, part travelogue, this will appeal to backyard birders.\" — Publisher\\'s Weekly \"Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.\" — Booklist \"I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” — The Washington Post About Arjan Dwarshuis Arjan Dwarshuis , a professional bird guide, writer,\\xa0and lecturer,\\xa0holds the current Guinness Book World Record for observing the largest number of bird species in a single year. In 2016, he launched his global “Big Year” and ultimately\\xa0observed 6,852\\xa0of the world’s roughly 10,700 bird species, setting a record that stands to this day. His yearlong adventure raised\\xa0nearly $50,000 for\\xa0the BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Program. Arjan also starred in the award-winning documentary Arjan’s Big Year and appears regularly on radio, television, and podcast programs in the Netherlands and beyond. He is a columnist for several magazines about nature, and\\xa0as the ambassador for the IUCN NL Land Acquisition Fund,\\xa0he is committed to the protection of birds across the globe.

The Black-bellied Hummingbird is one of the latest species Arjan Dwarshuis found in Costa Rica during his quest to break the global Big Year record and see 7,000 types of birds. Photo: Francesco Veronesi /Flickr CC (BY-SA 2.0) By Noah Strycker Contributor, Audubon Magazine Published November 17, 2016 Eleven months have passed since I wrapped up my Birding Without Borders quest: a world tour of 41 countries and seven continents, during which I recorded 6,042 species of birds in one whirlwind year. It was an incredible trip, and I’m now finishing a book about the experience. Sure, it was fun to set a world record, but I knew the number wouldn’t last forever. In fact, it stood just one year. Last week, Dutch birder Arjan Dwarshuis topped 6,100 species of birds so far in 2016, and he’s still going strong. He was in Costa Rica when he surpassed my total, logging a Black-bellied Hummingbird as one of his latest additions . Since January, Dwarshuis, a 30-year-old bartender and cooking enthusiast from Amsterdam, has crisscrossed Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and South and Central America with the single goal of notching as many bird species as possible. He has yet to visit North America, and plans to finish up with a return to Asia in December. “I’m very, very pleased,” he said in an interview with a Dutch news site. “Pleased that I broke the record; pleased that I broke it so early in the year.” Along the way, Dwarshuis received help from many birders—and all for a good cause. On a JustGiving page , he urges his followers to donate to BirdLife International’s Preventing Extinctions Programme, and has raised nearly $12,000, mostly from folks in the Netherlands.

Thank you so much #swarovskioptik and #vogelinformatiecentrumtexel for this awesome equipment! #birding #biggestyear #surinam #sponsoring photo by Humberto Tan A photo posted by Arjan Dwarshuis (@arjandwarshuis) on Jul 15, 2016 at 7:46am PDT It has been interesting to keep tabs on his progress after my own Big Year in 2015, when I eclipsed the existing record of 4,341 set by British birders Ruth Miller and Alan Davies in 2008. Each new attempt builds on the last, incorporating fresh knowledge and strategies, and I’m happy to see the torch passed on. Dwarshuis has followed a similar route and approach to mine with a few tweaks. Of the 41 countries I visited last year, he elected not to go to Antarctica, Cameroon, or Myanmar (where I averaged fewer unique species) while substituting some destinations that I missed: Ethiopia, Malawi, a couple of Caribbean islands, Suriname, and Java. He’s succeeded in pacing each leg based on the number of species that might be found there, keeping up the daily average of new sightings. Like me, he has depended heavily on local birding communities, offset his carbon emissions, and submitted sightings to an online database that tracks bird populations (I used eBird.org ; he uses observation.org ). I hope these strategies will become standard for future Big Years, should others take up the challenge. It’s also worth noting that Dwarshuis plays by a different taxonomy, which has caused some confusion with numbers. Instead of the Clements Checklist (used for all previous global Big Years), he follows the IOC World Bird List , a progressive authority that recognizes more species. By that measure (IOC v. 6.3), my 2015 year list was 6,153 species, which Dwarshuis has also now passed. With just seven weeks to go, Dwarshuis is aiming for 7,000—and who knows? With a productive session in North America this month and a fast end-of-the-year tour through Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan, he might just make it. In any case, the Big Year record is getting a major shake-up. Records, of course, are made to be broken, and any number is evanescent compared to the experience behind it. (A similarly thrilling contest is brewing in North America this year.) Each Big Year is a personal journey, like climbing a high peak or even mastering a soufflé. Birding, in its many variations, celebrates the infinite details of life on Earth—and birds can help illuminate the world in unexpected ways. In the context of other headlines this week, I think a global birdwatching record is especially symbolic: It shows that no one is truly isolated, and that great things are achieved by working together across all kinds of borders. I tip my hat to Arjan Dwarshuis, the new Big Year record holder, and wish him good birding for the rest of the year.

His guide plunged in, bare-footed. Nils paused, then followed. He breathed a sigh of relief. But 10 minutes later, the narrow canyon meant they had to cross the stream again. The guide shrugged. Bouillard realized this was going to be a very long afternoon and not the gentle one-hour hike he was promised. Twenty stream crossings later, he finally arrived. And he achieved his goal: seeing an endemic species of bat. Yes, a bat. Nils had not only trekked the treacherous path, he had traveled more than 9,000 miles from home to do so. Last year, Nils embarked on one of the more unusual nature quests: to see as many bat species around the world as he could in a year. A Big Bat Year. Photo © Nils Bouillard He modeled the idea on the popular concept of the Big Year in birding, where birders attempt to see as many bird species as possible in one calendar year. A Big Year might be in a yard , a county, a state or a continent. Lately, the global Big Year has achieved the status of sporting even for bird nerds, with enthusiasts tracking the travels of birding celebrities as they tick species after species. The Big Year has spawned its own sub-genre of books and blogs, and even a popular Hollywood film. Let’s get this out of the way: Bat watching is not birding. Nils acknowledges this up front. “A lot of bats are small and brown,” he says. “They’re not easy to see. Many only are active at night. Some species you can only determine using ridiculously difficult ID features like comparing the first and second phalanx of the thumb.” But look more deeply into the world of bats, Nils argues, and you’ll find a surprising array of interesting little animals. You’ll see some of the greatest natural spectacles on earth. And unlike birding – where the path is well trod – batting offers the chance for genuine exploration, even discovery. A Mexican free-tailed bat in Eckert James River Bat Cave Preserve in Mason, Texas. Photo © Karine Aigner From Birds to Bats Nils’s fascination with bats began, perhaps paradoxically, with birds. He had been getting serious about birds and exploring the local natural areas around his Belgian home. He was invited to take part in a local bat survey near the town of Chimay, a town more famous for beer than bats. “When I saw my first bat, a gray long-eared bat, up close, I just fell in love with them,” he says. “I wanted to know everything about them.” Nils Bouillar records bat echolocation calls. Photo © Nils Bouillard He began taking others for walks to look for bats, and realized that, while many people had misperceptions about the flying mammals, they also were open to learning. About the same time, he began following the adventures of birding Big Year superstars like Noah Strycker and Arjan Dwarshuis. After completing a master’s degree in ecology, he decided it was time to go batting around the world. He noted that most bat enthusiasts were more about the creatures themselves than lists. But he found himself thinking about applying birding concepts to batting, and launched the idea for his own Bat Big Year. “There are about 1,400 species of bats on earth,” he says. “I wanted a way to educate people about this diversity and to encourage people to conserve these mammals.” “The rules for a birding Big Year are well established,” says Nils. “For bats, I had to establish my own rules for what counted.” This could prove tricky, as bats are not nearly as visible as birds. Nils decided the following would count on his list: any bat in hand (when netted or caught by a researcher), roosting bats that could be positively identified and bat echolocation calls he recorded on a bat detector. Bats just darting by in the air can usually not be identified, so they didn’t count. Mexican free-tailed bats departing the Bracken Bat Cave in Texas. Photo © Karine Aigner / TNC A Lot of Bats And how did Nils fare? He acknowledges it was harder than he thought, as finding bats on his own in unfamiliar places proved a significant challenge. The emotional toll of being away from home so frequently cost him his relationship. He felt homesick, particularly when the batting proved difficult. As he wrote on his blog: “I also had no idea how challenging finding the bats would actually be. Trip reports make it sound easy but the reality is very different. The rules I have set myself probably didn’t help in that regard as they have cost me a number of species but I had to set some limitations and I decided to be quite stringent with them.” Still, he saw bats. Lots of bats. He traveled to 29 countries on six continents, and saw 396 species. (As a comparison, Arjan Dwarshuis’s record-breaking birding Big Year netted 6,852 species). Along the way, Nils rediscovered a bat species thought extinct in New Caledonia. He documented a potentially new bat species, one of his childhood dreams. He visited Texas’s Bracken Cave, thought to be home to the largest bat colony on earth, with legendary bat conservationist Merlin Tuttle. Merlin Tuttle and Nils Bouillard. Photo © MerlinTuttle.org / Rozanne Rathge “The people I met made the trip,” says Nils. “As my year progressed, other bat enthusiasts learned about what I was doing, and invited me to visit. I met up with researchers and volunteers who shared my passion, and who were interested in advocating for bat conservation.” Nils spent time in the Pacific, where many islands have endemic species. (The Solomon Islands, for instance, have 40 bat species). He spent 16 days in the Phillipines, where he saw the world’s largest bat – Acerodon jubatus – as well as spectacular bat caves. He observed spectacular yellow-wing bats using building roofs as perches to hunt at night in central Kenya and peered in “leaf tents” at roosting Honduran white bats in Costa Rica.

He continues to advocate for the protection of bats. “It’s a sensitive time for bat conservation,” he says. “Bats get blamed for a lot. But most people don’t hate them, they just don’t know much about them. That’s a starting point for education.” That includes responsible bat viewing. Nils didn’t enter any caves in North America due to potential spread of white-nose syndrome, a fungus that is devastating bats. He is careful not to disturb roosting bats. But he believes that bat tourism has potential in many parts of the world. Grey-headed flying foxes in Australia. Photo © Aaron Fellmeth Photography / Flickr Batting for the Casual Naturalist While Nils holds a slight hope someone will follow in his footsteps, and perhaps break his record, he’s also realistic. “It was very challenging in every way,” he says. “And bat listing is never going to be like birding.” However, along the way he found many eco-tourism opportunities that could introduce people to bats. The emergence of thousands or millions of bats from caves is an impressive spectacle that can be enjoyed by anyone. Some reserves, like Tirimbina in Costa Rica, will take naturalists out on bat netting surveys. Nils even found a community in Thailand that would take visitors out to see one spectacular species, the painted bat. “I think casual batting has a lot of potential, especially as an offering at eco-lodges,” he says. “When local people realize they can make an income from preserving species, whether birds or bats, it can lead to better protection.” And now that Nils is back at home, with no travel possible? He’s still batting. “I can walk out of my house in Belgium and see bats,” he says. “I’ve recorded seven species so far. I’m still a bat fanatic. And one of the best parts of this big year is that I’ve learned there are many others like me.” Published on June 15, 2020 - Updated on February 6, 2023 Join the Discussion Show comments (3) Join the Discussion Cancel reply Please note that all comments are moderated and may take some time to appear.

I gauge the seasons by the nightly appearance of canyon bats when the temperatures rise, visiting Mexican free-tailed bats– mothers and pups– from May to October, and lesser long-nosed bats drinking each night at my hummingbird feeders from August through September https://radio.azpm.org/p/radio-azspot-episodes/2016/7/14/91965-the-art-of-paying-attention-bats/ Reply Steve Plumb says: June 19, 2020 The painted bat looked fantastic so I did a search to find more pictures. I was shocked to find that many of them where from ebay where one can buy preserved bats to collect. As they are mammals and many are endangered it seems this shouldn’t be legal. I recall many caves and roosts are off limits to humans. Isn’t there a general ban on wildlife import? Or is that just for the living? Reply Michael Marchiano says: June 18, 2020 Being a Bat enthusiast myself, I really enjoyed the article. Over the years as a naturalist I have tried especially hard to dispel the general public’s ignorance  and prejudices for many of our maligned creatures, bats included. (the others being, snakes, spiders, scorpions and a large part of the insect world) I was really amazed at the number of species he was able to see and identify……I firmly believe in his conclusion about eco-tourism….give the public a chance to educate themselves and slowly we over come our fears and ignorance.

Today was on my own turf, a big day in the Netherlands, in the Dutch Delta estuary system more specifically.... I met the team 7:00 AM sharp at The Hague Central Station. Vincent van der Spek, Rinse van der Vliet, Max van Waasdijk - my travel companion for the next 2.5 months - and of course my girlfriend Camilla Dreef, an avid birdwatcher herself. The game was on! Our first target was a difficult one, Twite. However we had remarkably little difficulty as 3 birds dropped in overhead while we were watching a mixed group of Chilean and European Flamingos in the twilights. Next on the agenda were two other passerines that - like the Twite - normally make their home on the windswept tundra, Snow Bunting and Shore Lark. As with the Twite we immediately struck gold. While enjoying these stunning birds suddenly a huge bird swept overhead, WHITE-TAILED EAGLE!! An unexpected bonus. Right on schedule we headed to what could possibly be my first lifer for this Biggest Year, the female Pine Bunting that had chosen the Dutch delta as its unlikely wintering ground. Within minutes of arrival I marveled at this huge Dutch rarity! We were smashing through the delta like an elephant through a porcelain cabinet! At the bunting site we were informed about a Long-eared Owl roost in the village of Oostkapelle. The birds were quickly found and it was a real treat to see Camilla with a broad grin on her face as she photographed what is possibly our planet's most beautiful owl! We kept our mental pace going and in quick succession we notched up quality birds like Black Guillemot, Shag, 3 species of Diver, 4 species of Grebe, Razorbill, Gannet, an unexpected wintering Whimbrel, the vulnerable Velvet Scoter and Long-tailed Duck and the notoriously difficult Green Woodpecker and Grey Partridge. As dusk set in we enjoyed our last bird of the day: Pink-footed Goose. We tallied in at an amazing 118 species without even setting foot in a forest! A famous Dutch saying goes: 'Een goed begin is het halve werk', which means 'A good start is half the work'. Well I sure as hell hope so! What an awesome start to this Biggest Year! Dear friends, family and sweet Camilla, I will miss you... Off to the UAE! Pine Bunting Emberiza leucocephalos (Max van Waasdijk) January 2rd 2016: DIPPOCOLIUS After clearing customs at Dubai airport we met local birder Mike Barth for a solid day of chasing targets through the Emirates. The first target was immediately an important one, a monotypic family and a must-see for every serious world birder: Crab Plover. En route Mike - who quickly pointed out 2 stunning White-tailed Lapwings in the middle of a roundabout - told us about the difficulties for a birder living in Dubai. Because of the rapid ongoing spatial development in the Emirates the landscape changes constantly which means that a birding site could be good one day and turned into a building site the next day. Luckily the mudflats were still there and 6 Crab Plovers were quickly found. After admiring these highly sought after black-and-white waders we did what us Dutchmen do best, scoping for waders. This meant that we could add new year ticks in quick succession. After the wader bonanza and a quick stop for two Socotra Cormorants we headed to a small protected stretch of mangrove-forest where we enjoyed fantastic views of no less than 6 Greater Spotted Eagles circling overhead. A definite world rarity and a bird that is disappearing quickly in the western part of its range due to hybridization with Lesser Spotted Eagle. Next we drove out into the desert where we picked up the range-restricted winter visitor Red-tailed Wheatear and the ' Halimodendra ' subspecies of Lesser Whitethroat. At 4 PM we met local birder Oscar Campbell at the Abu Dhabi golf course to hopefully pick up the also monotypic and for me most wanted Grey Hypocolius. Oscar explained to us that the birds would surely fly overhead towards their roosting site in the mangroves so I kinda thought it would be a sure thing... Boy did I think wrong... The waiting was interrupted when I suddenly noticed a large white rumped swift flying past: PACIFIC SWIFT! The 4th record for the UAE! Oscar went bananas. Why does this happen here and never back home in the Netherlands (I also found the first Laughing Gull for the Gambia about a decade ago)? After a long wait Oscar picked up a group of passerines that were surely Hypocolius, but as soon as I got my bins on the very distant flock they disappeared behind the tribune of the Abu Dhabi race track. SHIT! All I had seen was a compact flock of long tailed birds with rounded wings, just not good enough for a tick, but you can bag to differ. Anyways it will not go on the list. So I opted for the new name Dippocolius. January 3rd DESERT DOWNPOURS Last night Mike had dropped us off at Laurent Frangies' place. A good friend of mine that I knew from uni and who now lives in Dubai! At 5:30 AM we left Laurent's place in his prized possession, a Toyota GX.R. To get into a winning mode we put on my playlist of 'glam rock' music and as we drove off into the desert Europe's 'Rock the Night' blazed through the speakers. At dawn we arrived at Wadi Masafi. A nice quiet gorge in the mountain range east of Dubai. The walk through the wadi was great and produced the range-restricted Plain Leaf Warbler, Scrub Warblers, lots of Desert Larks and Hume's Wheatear and another Red-tailed Wheatear. While enjoying these desert specialties dark thunderclouds packed over our heads and as we drove towards the coast we soon found ourselves in a tropical downpour, in the middle of the desert! We decided to shelter at a local restaurant right at the beach and while Laurent enjoyed his well-deserved coffee we scoped the sea. Not a bad decision as we soon found several Persian Shearwaters foraging offshore! An unexpected bonus and lifer! As we drove further south along the coast we checked for flocks of gulls and terns and after doing so for half an hour we hit the Jackpot, a huge flock of terns and gulls right on the beach! We counted no less than 7 different species of tern and 5 species of gull! Among them a fantastic White-cheeked tern that allowed Max some great photo opportunities. In addition to this we had close-up views of a Saunders Tern, only reliable here as the very similar Little Tern does not occur this time of the year in the UAE. We had a plane to catch so we drove back towards Dubai, but not before a toilet break materialized into an unexpected pair of Black-crowned Sparrow-lark! We said goodbye to Laurent and so is the first short leg of this Biggest Year completed, off to Sri Lanka!! White-tailed Lapwing Vanellus leucurus (Max van Waasdijk) Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga (Max van Waasdijk) Red-tailed Wheatear Oenanthe chrysopygia (Max van Waasdijk) White-cheeked Tern Sterna repressa (Max van Waasdijk) January 4th THE JUICE IS WORTH THE SQUEEZE When on a Biggest Year you can't afford to 'chill' since the clock is constantly ticking and you need to be constantly ticking. So after a delayed 4 hour flight to Colombo - Sri Lanka - and another 4 hours by minivan we arrived at Sinharaja right at the crack of dawn! What a change of scene, yesterday afternoon we were birding in the desert, now we found ourselves in hot steaming lowland forest! I've never had a warmer welcome anywhere than here in Sri Lanka, Jetwing Ecoholidays had provided us with our own minivan and driver, a very knowledgeable and friendly guide Shantha and a gift bag containing an illustrated checklist, the birdguide for Sri Lanka and a Hawaii-shirt with birds on it! What an ospious start to my Biggest Year! Soon we found ourselves on the Sinharaja trail system chasing endemics. The trick in Sinharaja is to find that mega mixed feeding-flock, but as the morning ticked away and the sun began to burn we failed to do so... We were just starting to worry when the game-changer came. A loud 'Pjong!' echoed through the forest, our guide froze and esthetically whispered 'Green-billed Coucal'! Seconds later we marveled at the beast that produced this bizarre call, we were back in the game! We had found a Spot-winged Thrush, Malabar Trogon and a very tame flock of the radiant Ceylon Blue Magpie, but still no feeding flock... Than it happened, the typical sound of a feeding flock rose in the distance and the first birds started dropping in overhead. Moments later we were surrounded by birds: another Green-billed Coucal, Blue Magpies, the rare Ashy-headed Laughingthrush, a pair of Crimson-baked Flamebacks and many Orange-billed and Sri Lankan Scimitar-Babblers, fantastic! We had just finished our very tasty lunch when Shantha urged us to go back to the van. To our surprise we didn't drove down, but back up again to where we had come from. Turned out one of the local guides had found a roosting Serendip Scops Owl, an endangered bird described new to science only as recent as 2004! We enjoyed reasonable views as the bird remained well hidden in a vine tangle, but any more movement from our side would surely disturb this threatened species, so we refrained from going any closer. What a day! We walked back to the van, but Shantha had one more surprise for us up his sleeve, a fantastic pair of Ceylon Frogmouth! Now completely satisfied and completely exhausted we fell asleep in the back of the van during the 6 hour drive towards the Horton Plains... Ceylon Frogmouth Batrachostomus moniliger (Max van Waasdijk) Ceylon Blue Magpie Urocissa ornata (Max van Waasdijk) Green-billed Coucal Centropus chlororhynchos (Max van Waasdijk) Red-faced malkoha Phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus (Max van Waasdijk) January 5th HORTON PLAINS POWER PLAY The alarm rang at 04:30 AM, a bit of a petty since we were staying at the very luxurious Jetwing St. Andrews Hotel and we had no time to enjoy this fantastic place - sponsored to us by Jetwing Ecoholidays - during day-time. However, we were here on a mission to notch-up all the Sri Lanka endemics in just a couple of days, so resting would have to come some other time. We reached the gates of Horton Plains NP still in the twilight, but already there was a huge assemblage of minivans filled with eager tourist wanting to reach 'The World's End' lookout point in time to see the sunrise. We however had a very different reason to be here so early, namely the shy and endangered Ceylon Whistling-thrush. The Whistling-thrush-site was a scenic one, a small lily-covered pond near a stream surrounded by cloud-forest-covered hillsides, not a bad place to start off the day! We were there for barely 5 minutes when I flushed a bird from the roadside, the blue shine on its back was unmistakable and I whispered 'Whistling-Thrush'! Luckily the bird perched for a few seconds, allowing excellent views of this world-rarity! After this flying start we kept the pace going and saw all the possible high-elevation endemics before 12 AM, however we still needed two highly sought-after winter migrants, Kashmir Flycatcher and the beautiful Pied Thrush. There was one small problem, we arrived at Victoria Park at midday, which made conditions for birding tough. Still we managed to obtain fantastic views of no less than 3 Pied Thrushes and a vagrant Eyebrowed Thrush behind a small toilet building. The flycatcher proved elusive today and despite 2,5 hours of intensive searching we just could not find it, the first real dip for our Sri Lanka trip was a fact. From the Horton Plains it was another 6 hours drive to the Jetwing Yala Hotel, which meant that the last hour automatically turned into a night drive. This materialized in a sighting of a Jungle Cat in the middle of the road, a fantastic finish and the missed flycatcher was quickly forgotten! Pied Thrush Geokichla wardii (Max van Waasdijk) January 6th BACK TO SINHARAJA A now familiar pre-dawn start meant that we arrived at Bungala National Park just as the sun rose over this beautiful wetland. As expected new birds came thick-and-fast and in addition to large numbers of waders and egrets we found several good species like Watercock, Spot-billed Pelican and Pallas's Grasshopper Warbler. I would have loved to spend more time in this lush wetland, but we had to leave early since there were still a couple of endemics lurking somewhere in the mountains of Sri Lanka... So after another 5 hour drive we were back were we had started, Sinharaja! This time with a very specific hit-list. First on this list was the Sri Lankan Thrush, a shy and rare Zoothera thrush that is notoriously difficult to find. Luck was on our side however, since it was dripping wet after a recent tropical downpour; ideal conditions for ground dwelling thrushes looking for tasty worms and snails! Soon a Thrush was flushed from the trail and perched for more than 10 minutes at eye-level, awesome! On the way back we had two close encounters with another endemic Zoothera , Spot-winged Thrush and our local guide pointed a second Serendip Scops Owl out for us, nice! This one allowed for better photo-opportunities than the one on the first day. Near the entrance we made short business of another target, White-faced Starling and moments later two Sri Lanka Grey Hornbills flew in! Now there were just two endemics left for us to find at Sinharaja! We spend the night in the lovely Martin's Lodge, just a stone's throw away from the Sinharaja gate and just as the sun set over the Sri Lankan mountains a Chestnut-backed Owlet began to call, one more endemic to go... Sri Lanka Thrush Zoothera imbricata (Max van Waasdijk) Spot-winged Thrush Geokichla spiloptera (Max van Waasdijk) Serendib Scops Owl Otus thilohoffmanni (Max van Waasdijk) January 7th ENDEMICS, GONNA CATCH 'M ALL! Today we were going after a notoriously shy gamebird, the Sri Lankan spurfowl. Well it used to be a challenging bird to come to grips with, but recently a stake-out had been found at the edge of the lower part of Sinharaja. A local community has started feeding the birds and every day around 9 AM this beautiful white-spotted bird creeps out of the forest to forage on seeds behind one of the houses. This is a great way to involve a local community in conservation practices, since they earn good money from visiting birders that hope to see the spurfowl, these people are strongly motivated to protect it. Initiatives like this are now set up all over the world and are beneficial to both birders, local people and most importantly birds! While we were waiting for this elusive skulker there was a lot of action in the lush rainforest surrounding the small village and to our big surprise we soon enjoyed fantastic views of both Green-billed Coucal and Red-faced Malkoha! Even rarer was a flock of 4 White-faced Starlings scoped in a distant tree. While enjoying a fantastic Chestnut-backed Owlet one of the elders came rushing in urging us to come with him and there it was, our last wet-zone endemic, Sri Lanka Spurfowl, what a stunning bird! After the Sinharja clean-up we drove down to the coast to find another target, this time not an endemic, but nevertheless a bird that I had been longing to see for quite some time now, Indian Pitta, hypothetically my 10th species in this most stunning of the worlds' bird families. And yes, Buddha was again good to us and we managed to find no less than 3 birds at a forest stakeout! Now we had one more day in Sri Lanka to hopefully find our final endemic, Sri Lanka Wood-shrike, a dry-zone specialist. I didn't expect this Sri Lanka trip to go this smooth and in retrospect I could have even done it in 4 days, well it was the first country that I had properly planned when constructing my Biggest Year itinerary (back than there were 'only' 23 countries in the itinerary, now there are 41), so I guess I have to give myself some slag. For everybody out there doubting whether I will be able to combine hardcore birding, making a documentary movie, blogging and fundraising simultaneously - read Leon - I love this and trust me, I will only step up my game from now on. I would like to stress one more time that with this Biggest Year I hope to raise awareness and funding for the Preventing Extinctions Programme, so to everybody reading and enjoying this blog, please do have a look at my Tilt fundraising page! Enjoying Chestnut-backed Owlet (Arjan Dwarshuis) Sri Lanka Spurfowl Galloperdix bicalcarata (Max van Waasdijk) January 8th GOODBYE BEAUTIFUL SRI LANKA Last night we had a fantastic dinner at the Jetwing Beach Resort with Keith Wijesuriya and his wife. Keith is the guy who invited me to come to Sri Lanka and arranged this fantastic trip sponsored by Jetwing Eco Holidays. After elaborating on the fantastic trip we had so far we suddenly noticed it was already 11 PM and since we woke at 4:30 AM I felt a bit shaky today, but as soon as I got my bins on a magnificent Brown Fish Owl - at a wetland reserve north of Colombo - I was back in business! We thoroughly enjoyed our final day on this lush island and managed to find the last of the endemics, Sri Lanka Woodshrike, a recent addition to the Sri Lanka list! We also saw the local red-backed subspecies of Black-rumped Flameback that will surely get split in the near future. We returned to the resort around lunchtime since I had an interview this afternoon with three journalist of three different Sri Lankan newspapers! Fantastic exposure for my trip and for my fundraiser so I was more than happy to do so (we had seen all the endemics anyhow). After the interview we had a couple of hours before our flight to India, so this gave me plenty time to finish-up this blog, enjoy! We will leave for India with 342 species in 8 days' time, not bad I would say. Happy Birding!

When Arjan Dwarshuis first heard of the “Big Year”—the legendary record for birdwatching—he was twenty years old, it was midnight, and he was sitting on the roof of a truck in the Andean Mountains. In that moment he promised himself that, someday, somehow, he would become a world-record-holding birder. Ten years later, he embarked on an incredible, arduous, and perilous journey that took him around the globe; over uninhabited islands, through dense unforgiving rainforests, across snowy mountain peaks and unrelenting deserts—in just a single year. Would he survive? Would he be able to break the “Big Year” record, navigating through a world filled with shifting climate and geopolitical challenges? The (Big) Year that Flew By is an unforgettable, personal exploration of the limits of human potential when engaging with the natural world. It is a book about birds and birding and Arjan’s attempts to raise awareness for critically endangered species, but it is also a book about overcoming mental challenges, extreme physical danger, and human competition and fully realizing your passions through nature, adventure, and conservation. “Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.” ― Booklist “I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” —The Washington Post Reviews and Praise “Dutch birders take their pursuit to a higher plane of skill and intensity, as exemplified in this global trek by Arjan Dwarshuis. A fast-paced page-turner and a unique adventure story, The (Big) Year that Flew By is also filled with insights about landscapes, people, and a world of wonderful birds.” —Kenn Kaufman, author of Kingbird Highway More Reviews and Praise “Arjan artistically weaves together the beauty of the birds, the importance of conservation, and the complex logistics of non-stop travel. The roller coaster highs of seeing a target bird, paired with the lows of absolute fatigue and exhaustion, are an innate undertone of any birder’s big year.” —Tiffany Kersten, birding guide and continental U.S. Big Year record holder “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is not simply a celebration of a broken record but a global call to action to protect the habitats that birds rely on for survival. A Big Year of birding is a massive undertaking, requiring a Herculean effort to successfully plan and execute. While this quest involves daunting logistics and emotional hurdles, the most notable achievement is distilling so much lived experience into a single book. Arjan has conquered both, beautifully capturing\\xa0remote wild places and conveying the\\xa0intensity endured to find and observe nearly three-quarters of the world’s bird species. Arjan’s contagious passion for birds infuses his account of a global avian scavenger hunt like no other.” —Christian Hagenlocher, author of the Falcon Freeway “An astonishing achievement! Arjan Dwarshuis’s\\xa0year\\xa0was so\\xa0big\\xa0it covered an entire planet. His eagle eyes took in almost 7,000 species of bird and brought into sharp focus their often-fragile existence. Dwarshuis’s heartfelt prose reminds us that many of these species are living on the edge—just a generation or two away from extinction. Yet this is a story of hope—Dwarshuis shines a light on the many communities around the world banding together to save their local birdlife. This book is a glorious tribute to the wealth of beauty and diversity found in birds, and a clarion call for us all to care about the future of birds everywhere. “ —Neil Hayward, author of Lost Among the B irds “ The (Big) Year that Flew By is somehow both a fast-paced race through and an in-depth immersion in an amazing birding big year. Arjan Dwarshuis does an excellent job of portraying the excitement, stress, and exertion that are part of any Big Year, but that was even more so in his record-breaking worldwide Big Year. I very much enjoyed reading his account, sometimes with my heart pounding, as I lived his journey with him, feeling joy when he managed to find another rarity, concern with his bird-seeking struggles, and sorrow in his very rare misses. As I read, I continued to be impressed by the logistics required for all his travels, and by the excellent people who helped him find all these bird species. His interspersing of tales of his early birding years helped me better understand the how and why he was able to pull off his remarkable feat as well as his passion for birding. Throughout this book, he also explained conservation concerns and advances as they relate to the birds he sought, providing words of wisdom and words of hope. In his conclusion, he admits that while flying all over the world does use much energy, ecotourism in many far-flung places has been and continues to be of great importance in saving birds and habitats. I especially appreciate his conclusion in which he asks his readers to adopt a positive attitude and do their part—\\'enjoy nature and look up to the sky.’” —Lynn Barber, author of Extreme Birder “Arjan’s story is brilliantly told. I was with him every step of the way. It is much more than just a story about one man’s bid to see as most of the world’s bird species in one year as humanly possible. No, this is an epic journey by a man who’s not only obsessed with birds but who has a deep spiritual connection with the planet as he observes the environments and habitats he encounters. It is clear that we have to do more to take care of our world and all its inhabitants, including us.” —David Lindo, author of How to be an Urban Birder \"[An] entertaining debut . . . . [that] offers colorful glimpses into the locales the author visits. . . . Part birding journal, part travelogue, this will appeal to backyard birders.\" — Publisher\\'s Weekly \"Dwarshius’ exhilarating race against time across 40 countries and 6 continents in his attempt to break the world record will thrill armchair readers and bird enthusiasts alike.\" — Booklist \"I sped through [this] book, trying to ignore feelings of jealousy as Dwarshuis described moments with species I’ve dreamed of seeing.” — The Washington Post About Arjan Dwarshuis Arjan Dwarshuis , a professional bird guide, writer,\\xa0and lecturer,\\xa0holds the current Guinness Book World Record for observing the largest number of bird species in a single year. In 2016, he launched his global “Big Year” and ultimately\\xa0observed 6,852\\xa0of the world’s roughly 10,700 bird species, setting a record that stands to this day. His yearlong adventure raised\\xa0nearly $50,000 for\\xa0the BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Program.

You Can Do Both! by | April 26, 2020 Tweet Virtually every D SLR today has the capability of shooting video but many who have shot some video often stopped after just a few attempts. Why? Because they did nothing with the video afterwards. This does not have to be. Editing, provided you don’t get too fancy, can be relatively easy and fast, once you know how. And, you can often extract usable stills from a video clip. That’s what I’d like to address here. In Photoshop, you can select a specific frame to extract as a still image and work on that frame much as you would do with any image. I’ve done this several times when, by only shooting video, I’ve missed a still shot. You can’t do stills and video simultaneously. Getting a high-quality image from a video clip depends upon the format that you captured the video with, and to some extent, how large a file you’ll want for the still image. For best results, 4K videos will give you the largest file size, typically around 4096 x 2160, which is about 4/5th the file size of some RAW formats. Provided the subject is still, you can make a good quality image from an extracted frame. And here’s the rub. You should shoot a 4K video at either 1/48th sec or 1/60th sec These recommended shutter speeds are twice the frame rate of the video capture, and that’s either 24fps or 30fps (frames per second), depending upon the video setting you are using. However, neither speed is conducive for capturing motion. You can shoot 4K video at higher shutter speeds to freeze motion, but the resulting video will look choppy or jerky. Some cameras offer high speed or slow motion video, at 120fps, and although the best shutter speed might be twice that, approximately 1/250th sec, you can go faster and the slow motion video will still look good. Sound isn’t recorded at that frame rate, and the file size may be only about 1/4th the size of a 4K capture. You can extract a frame for small images, appropriate for the web or for small prints, but the quality doesn’t compare with 4K or even a normal jpg image captured in camera. To increase sharpness with these smaller files I use Topaz Sharpen AI. But the beauty of video is, truly, its story-telling capabilities. Recently I photographed and videoed a Spring Peeper calling, and while I would have been happy with the stills, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I really didn’t convey what I really saw and heard, but the video clips sure did. Editing can seem intimidating, but a good video is a great reward for the effort. I’d been frustrated in trying to decipher books on video editing, and felt there was a real need for an easy-to-follow guide that would take anyone through the important steps. So I wrote one, and you can get it on my website: 25 Key Essential Steps to Making a Great Video with Adobe Premiere CC . 1. Spring Peeper –A and Spring Peeper – B One image is a still shot and the other a still lifted from a video clip taken a few seconds later. Can you tell which one is from the video still? 2. Same question, different pose. Which one is the video capture? 3. Brazilian Tapir. This video capture was from a 4K video clip. 4. Jaguar charge. This video capture was from a slow motion video capture and sharpened with Topaz AI Sharpen. 5. Jaguar charge to caiman. This video capture was from a slow motion video capture and sharpened with Topaz AI Sharpen. Shutter speed was not recorded, but I’m guessing about 1/2000th sec. Answers to Questions 1 Spring Peeper – A is the video capture. Although shot at 1/48th sec., the aperture was f16, so there is a lot of depth of field. The still was shot at f6.3. 2 Spring Peeper – A is the video capture. Both the still and the video capture were shot at the same aperture, f16.

I thought I would need to get used to missing some would-be-perfect images, but have actually been quite happy so far. With the right shutter speed, the quality of exported frame from video can be very high. I am filming 120fps slow motion bird video a lot these days, but somehow have not tried the 1/250 shutter speed yet. Thanks for the helpful tips and look forward to your new Youtube Channel!

Last night after Stratton Hatfield had picked me up from Nairobi airport we spent the night in a hotel not far from Nairobi NP. This morning we met Joseph Aengwo at the NP gate and with Stratton’s Landrover – our home for the next 6 days - we drove straight into the park. Unfortunately it was raining quite heavily and due to the recent rains the park was generally very wet, which made birding incredibly difficult. So after we ticked Shelley’s Francolin we said goodbye to Nairobi and headed for the Tanzanian border. We ran into some minor setbacks – first a wrong stamp in our passport, then a motorcycle that ran into us and a medication fee for the drivers’ fake injury - but round 13:00 PM we were finally across the border and on our way to Engikaret, better known as the Lark Plains. The plains got their name because they are the only known breeding site for the critically endangered Beesley’s Lark, a charismatic little lark that is down to only 67(!) individuals. At the plains we met Furaha Mbilinyi, a local Arusha birder who would join us for today and tomorrow. This was a great thing for multiple reasons because Furaha doesn’t just know Tanzanian birds and birding sites incredibly well, he is also a fantastic dude to hang around with! After paying a contribution to the local community who watches over the Lark Plains, we started our search for one of the rarest birds in Africa. As we drove out onto the plains the first two new birds we encountered were Greater Kestrel and the stunning Double-banded Courser. It took a while before we found the first larks, but after having fantastic sightings of both Short-tailed Lark and Athi Short-toed Lark we stumbled upon 3 very nice Beesley’s Larks! What a privilege to see these incredibly rare birds in the wild! It is good to see that the community is involved with its conservation and benefits from this species. In my opinion this is the only way to protect this incredibly vulnerable bird. After this success we drove to friends of Stratton – Adrian and Carmen – who had kindly invited us to spend this and the following night at their place. 3000 species! (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 11th MURPHY’S LAW We started our day on a role! As it was just getting light I got my 3000 th species this year, the Rufous-tailed Weaver! The bird following that was even better in my opinion, a stunning Lesser Moorhen, an intra-African migrant that I had missed many times before. We than made short work of Ashy Starling, Yellow-collared Lovebird and best, a Tanzanian Red-billed Hornbill. So far so good, but as we drove back towards Arusha we got our first fine for speeding, well we were doing 40 on a 50 km/h stretch, but lets just say that those Tanzanian cops felt creative today. Around Lake Duluti we found Brown-breasted- and White-eared Barbet, only my second-ever Green-backed Honeybird and the range-restricted Tavetta Golden Weaver. As we drove towards a roadside snack bar for lunch we were almost nailed again by a roadside gang of cops, this time they couldn’t catch us for speeding, but they gave it their best to fine us for not wearing seatbelts on the back seat (meanwhile an open pick-up with two broken mirrors, 12 people and 6 goats passed us with 70 km/h). That lunch was the turning point I guess, since from that point on we were harassed wherever we went. While searching for Lyne’s Cisticola we accidently drove across a dirt road that apparently belonged to some very unfriendly Masaai, instead of helping us to get where we were going they threatened and harassed us until we had no other option than to pay them. On the next road we tried exactly the same thing happened, this time the guy we had paid ran off into a cornfield never to be seen again. By now we seemed to have lost all our momentum and on our way back to Arusha – dipping Hartlaub’s Bustard en route – we were pooled over again. Like last time we had done absolutely nothing wrong, but by some miracle this cop managed to turn our 40 km/h into 60. Tired from all the fines and 50 dollars lighter we drove back to Adrian and Carmen’s place for a well deserved braai, but not before we were pooled over one last time, this time Strattons’ fire-extinguisher had the wrong label on it (I shit you not)… Rufous-tailed Weaver Histurgops ruficaudus (Arjan Dwarshuis) Ashy Starling Lamprotornis unicolor (Arjan Dwarshuis) Taveta Golden Weaver Ploceus castaneiceps (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 12th UP INTO THE USAMBARAS! We left Arusha very early – so we would beat traffic – and headed east towards the Eastern Arc Mountains, our goal was to reach the Western Usambaras by late afternoon. On our way we tried hard for African Finfoot and African Skimmer, but our efforts proved fruitless. What we did find at our 5 th try was the notoriously difficult to find Rock-loving Cisticola. We arrived at Mullers Mountain Lodge in the Western Usambaras around 5 PM and after checking in we raced straight for the famous Sawmill Road, however it was gradually becoming dark and we could only get 3 or 4 specialties before we had to call it a day. Tomorrow we will chase some top-notch birds! May 13th CHASING MEGAS We drove up to the sawmill road when it was still dark, now and then listening for Usambara Nightjar and at our 5 th attempt we hit the jackpot with a calling bird. At the crack of dawn we were on the sawmill road with a very specific target list. By now I’m beginning to run out of species in East Africa so all my targets are pretty much hard to find, rare and endemic birds. We got our first Usambara endemic on the road while driving up, the recently split Usambaru Thrush and as it was slowly getting light we could hear White-breasted Alethes and Spot-throats calling from every direction, seeing them however proved incredibly difficult. We hit the first mega only an hour after arrival when Stratton brilliantly picked up a pair of the rare Usambara Weaver, feeding and calling in the canopy, this bird can often be one of the harder birds to come by in the Western Usambaras. By midday we had notched up most of the targets, but we still had to see a Spot-throat and a White-breasted Alethe and the rarest of them all, the Usambara Akalat, was still lacking from our list. We decided to go off road and straight through the forest, parallel to the road hoping to come across one or two skulkers. Suddenly we simultaneously picked up a movement in the undergrowth, I lifted my bins and there it was, an Usambara Akalat, one of the hardest East African birds to come by. It turned out to be a pair feeding on a small ant swarm. The fact that they were feeding meant that we could even take some reasonable pictures of this rarely photographed species. There were more birds attracted to the antswarm and at one point I had an Akalat, an Usambara Thrush and a Spot-throat in one frame, ridiculous! As you can imagine we savoured our Kilimanjaro beer that evening after cleaning up the Western Usambaras. Usambara Akalat Sheppardia montana (Arjan Dwarshuis) Usambara Thrush Turdus roehli (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 14th FACE TO FACE WITH THE NDUK We left the Western Usambaras early and drove to the Eastern Usambaras, about half a day drive since the last 30 kilometres up to the Amani Forest Camp are on a bad dirt road, to me this only adds to the adventure. We had a warm welcome at the Amani Forest Camp by the very hospitable hosts and as Carl is a chef we enjoyed an outstanding lunch while we scored our first two mega birds right in the garden, Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird and Banded Green Sunbird. After lunch we met our guide John with whom we drove down to a small creek, the apparent stakeout for the near mythical Dappled Mountain Robin. On our way down we saw a Half-collared Kingfisher. Half expecting not to hear or see even a glimpse of the bird I played the tape upon arrival at the site – nobody had seen it here for a long long time – but immediately Stratton heard the bird responding, I however missed the call completely. We waited for a while and I played again, almost immediately two birds zipped right over my head. Stratton got good looks, 100% Dapplethroat, but I only glimpsed it, not remotely enough for a tick. We tried for 3 more hours, but without any luck. We did have great looks at another rare robin, the Sharpe’s Akalat. After this debacle we went in search for another mega rare bird, the Long-billed Tailorbird. Here we had better luck with brief views of a single bird as it skulked through the bamboo. One down! While enjoying an outstanding dinner at the Amani Forest Camp, we suddenly heard a calling Nduk Eagle Owl, the absolute flagship species of the Usambaras. We raced down into the forest, but the bird didn’t call again. John told us that recently a pair proved reliable at the botanical gardens so we drove down there. Just as we opened the door of our car we heard the bizarre call of an Nduk Eagle Owl somewhere in the canopy next to the road, in the distance another bird responded. Now we had a problem, the bird was somewhere high up in the canopy, completely hidden from sight and despite shining our torch from multiple different angles, we just couldn’t see it. Suddenly some dogs started barking on the premises where we were standing on, which apparently spooked the bird. It flew to another tree and there we finally got amazing views. What a fantastic bird, definitely one of the absolute East African highlights this year! Unidentified frog (Arjan Dwarshuis) Unidentified frog (Arjan Dwarshuis) East Usambaras (Arjan Dwarshuis) May 15th RUNNING OUT OF NEW BIRDS We had done incredibly well yesterday, which meant that there were just three birds left to find for us in the Usambaras, the Dapple-throat, the Kretschmer’s Longbill and the Usambara Hyliota. We tried the full morning for the Dapple-throat, but it never called, let alone showed again. Our search for the Longbill eventually paid off, but it took more than two hours of off-trail hiking up and down hillsides before we finally got it. The whole afternoon we focussed on the Hyliota in a forest patch at 400 meters altitude, but despite our efforts we had no success. Despite a full day grinding through the forests of the Usambaras we only got three new species, than you know it is time to move :( May 16th GOODBYE TANZANIA! We spent the whole morning looking for the Hyliota, but at 9 AM we had to reluctantly end our search since I had a flight to catch to Antananarivo! Joseph, Stratton and me had a lot of fun on our last drive together this year, back to Arusha, but despite several stops we just couldn’t find a single new species and by the time I reached the airport it became clear that this was my first 0 species day… Tomorrow I’ll be in Madagascar where everything will be new! Thanks Stratton and Joseph for these awesome seven days. We had to work hard for new species, but we did get some incredibly rare ones!

And it makes sense: action shots are more engaging than static images, and the action of flight is the one thing that most expresses what it is to be a bird. So not surprisingly, within the world of wildlife photographers, Birds in Flight – or “BIF” – is a particular specialty with its own unique skill set. Short-billed Dowitcher. 500mm, \\xa0f/7.1, 1/2000 sec, ISO 800. Capturing great images of a birds in flight requires patience, skill, and judgement. I don’t claim to be anywhere close to having mastered this particular aspect of photography, but I have learned a few things along the way. Consider this a beginners’ guide to BIF. Birds in Flight – What makes a Great Image? Technical qualities . Needless to say, as with any great image, a BIF photo should show crisp focus, proper exposure, and enough depth of field so that the whole bird is in focus Activity . An image of a bird in its element is good enough, but it will be more engaging if the bird is doing something recognizable – carrying prey or nesting material, taking off or coming in for a landing, feeding, engaging with other birds, etc. Composition . As a general rule the bird should be: Flying towards the photographer or seen from a side view. The rear end view of a bird flying away is rarely interesting. Looking towards the viewer. For the best results the focus point should be on the nearest eye. Captured with its wings and legs held in an attractive manner. And be sure you leave some space in front of a flying bird. The image will look a bit claustrophobic if the bird  does not have room to fly. Background . A bird against a featureless white or blue sky is not as engaging as it would be with a more visually interesting background – glimpses of its habitat, for example a Northern Harrier over grassland or a Red-shouldered Hawk flying amongst the trees, or failing that at least some interesting clouds. Books, social media posts, and blogs on photography tend to slavishly favour the convention that the background should be out of focus lest it detract attention from the subject . This is actually a stylistic choice not a rule, and you should feel free to ignore it in favour of your own personal vision. Blue-footed Booby. 300mm, f/8.0, 1/1250 sec, ISO 400 Feral Pigeons at Dough Fluhrer Park. 200mm, f/7.1, 1/1600 sec, ISO 160. Approach The really great photographs of birds in flight that you have seen in exhibitions and magazines are almost certainly products of a deliberate approach to photography. What I mean by that is that the photographer set out that day aiming to get a particular image. They planned the shoot, considering the light conditions they were looking for, the best background, and where the birds could most advantageously be seen. \\xa0Thus preparation put them in the best position to get what they were looking for. That approach does not fit in well with the normal activities of birding, which usually comprise walking around and seeing the birds as they make themselves available. However there can be good opportunities on a bird walk, particularly in open country, if you adjust your camera up in advance with the settings you would need for a BIF opportunity. Almost all of the images in this article were captured while out birding. And sometimes you can just get lucky. I am quite pleased with the Red-rumped Bush Tyrant image which came about because on a really bright day I had dialed in a fast shutter speed just to avoid overexposure. :Red-rumped Bush Tyrant. 500mm, \\xa0f/5.6, 1/1000 sec, ISO 900. Red-tailed Hawk. 500mm, f/7.1, 1/1600 sec, ISO 400. Settings The most important setting you will need to adopt for shooting birds in flight is a much faster shutter speed than you normally use. Even birds like swans or herons that appear to be slow and ponderous are actually moving quite quickly. For example, as a Mute Swan flies by, its slow cruise speed of 30kph equates to almost nine metres per second –\\xa0 for a bird that is about a 1.5 metres long. Combined with the imperfect movement of your lens as you try to track the bird, at a normal shutter speed the resulting shot will be tend to be blurry, or at least not as sharp as you would want. So if you want to freeze the action and get a crisp shot you need a high shutter speed. How high? There are two answers: It depends on the bird – what it is doing, how close it is, whether it is heading towards you or across your field of vision. Experience will be your best guide in judging how fast the shutter needs to be. But if in doubt, faster is always better. Shutter Speed Guidelines for Birds in Flight I reviewed a lot of my own BIF images when researching this article and one thing I noticed is that most of the ones I like were taken at a shutter speed of 1/1600 or higher. For large, slow-flying or soaring birds (Canada Goose, Red-tailed Hawk) you might get away with a lower speed, particularly if the bird is in a slower phase of movement. The White-faced Ibis below is gliding in for a landing. In this case 1/800 was fast enough to catch the bird and even the water droplets falling off of it but it’s the exception rather than the rule. 1/1600 is better as a baseline – it will improve the number of “keepers” in a shooting session. White-faced Ibis at Erieau ON. 500mm, f/6.3, 1/800 sec, ISO 250. American White Pelican. 500mm, f/5.6, 1/2000 sec, ISO 1000. Note that the closer you are to the bird the faster it will cross through your field of vision, so an even higher speed may be needed. For smaller and/or faster-moving birds the need for speed increases. Each situation is different but as a starting point I would suggest the following minimum speeds: Gulls and other medium-sized birds – 1/2000 Swallows, martins and small passerines (e.g. flycatchers, chickadees etc) – start at 1/3200 and be prepared to go up from there, especially if the bird is flying towards you. Hummingbirds – these are a special case. When they are hovering, the best images often show a fair amount of blur of the wings while the body remains stationary (and thus in sharp focus). The blur gives the impression of how fast their wingbeat really is – up to 80 beats per second. Bank Swallow. 500mm, f/6.3, 1/3200 sec, ISO 500. Sapphire-spangled Emerald. 500mm, f/5.6, 1/1250 sec, ISO 4000. Technique Even the fastest shutter speed won’t guarantee a good image. You also need to be able to track the bird closely enough that your autofocus can achieve a lock. Modern cameras have fairly advanced abilities to achieve and maintain focus lock on a moving target, but you can help things out by developing and practicing good habits. Tracking . When you are photographing a series of birds flying across your field of vision, the natural tendency is to aim at a bird as it approaches and then try to twist your body to track it along its line of flight. More experienced BIF photographers decide where they want the bird to be when they take the shot, considering background and proximity, and set there feet so that when the bird hits that point it is straight in front of them. This gives them the greatest control at the critical moment. They then wind their torso left or right to the point where the bird will first appear. It’s a simple trick but it works. The image at the top of the page was shot using this method. A series of Short-billed Dowitchers were flying across a lagoon so it was possible to predict their movement and be set up for the side-on flight shot. Burst Mode . Even the best autofocus system will struggle to keep a moving target constantly in sharp focus. There will always be moments when the focus wanders a bit before the system corrects itself. You can help ensure you come away with some sharp images by firing bursts rather than single frames. To do this, set your shutter release mode to Continuous Low or Continuous High and hold the shutter release down when the bird enters your target zone. A side benefit of firing bursts is that it also gives you a better chance of acquiring an image where the bird is doing what you want it to do – looking towards you, holding its wings in a graceful manner, etc. Note the  series of unprocessed images of an Andean Gull below. This short burst took less than one second but you can see the variety of shapes and wing positions during that span. Longer bursts increase the chances of getting the shot you really want. Andean Gulls Environment . You can also use the wind to your advantage. All else being equal a bird flying into a headwind will be moving more slowly relative to the ground observer and thus easier to track. Light The use of fast shutter speeds significantly reduces the amount of light that reaches the camera’s sensor. In practice this means that BIF photography in low-light conditions will necessitate high ISO values with the attendant problem of excessive noise. The best results tend to come when there is full daylight but without the harsh glare of the midday sun. Days that are brightly-lit but overcast can provide excellent conditions as overly-bright highlights will be less of a problem, but in this case you will want to have something in the background other than a pale grey sky. And if you are shooting upwards on a bright day, for example at a soaring raptor, remember that exposure compensation is your friend. Increasing your exposure by a stop or two will avoid the dreaded underwing shadow and help you bring out the colour and detail of the bird’s undersides. Equipment In most situations all you need to start experimenting with birds in flight photography is the camera you already have (DSLR or mirrorless) and a telephoto lens. For close range work, for example chickadees at Lemoine Point, a shorter telephoto in the 200mm range will work, otherwise you should look for a lens of at least 300mm. My article on the September Blue Bill identified some good choices at various price levels. The only caveat is that if you start to shoot in long bursts you may need to upgrade to a faster memory card. If you become really enthusiastic about BIF then you may eventually want to look at a tripod with a gimbal mount. I may eventually head in this direction, but at the moment I almost exclusively hand-hold my cameras so I am not in a position to recommend specific options. Practice Like any other photography skill your ability to photograph birds in flight will improve with practice. Fortunately you don’t have to go far afield to work on your skills – nature has provided us with an ample supply of gulls, feral pigeons and Mallards that are abundant, easily found, and not too afraid of people. They are great subjects to work with as you start out on your BIF journey. Good shooting! …and if you find all of this too easy, and you really want to drive yourself mad, there’s always IIF – insects in flight. 😊 Forster’s Tern. 500mm, f/6.3, 1/2500 sec, ISO 400.

The trip contained moments of transcendent beauty and some truly grim events, but it was never boring. And yes, there were a few birds along the way! I will spare you a blow-by-blow account of a trip that, with travel time, lasted most of a month. But here are a few highlights. Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego Magellanic Woodpecker The company assembled in Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. We were travelling with British touring company Birdquest so there was no quiet settling-in period. On the first morning we had a rather strenuous hike up Garibaldi Pass, but successfully achieved the aim of nabbing the highly-desirable White-bellied Seedsnipe. In the following days we roamed through beautiful parks, shoreline, and the municipal dump, along the way getting cracking close-up views of Tierra del Fuego’s star bird – the Magellanic Woodpecker – along with most of the other endemic and local species. The final pre-boarding day saw us hop aboard a small boat for a cruise of the outer islands. A three-hour cruise . Thorn-tailed Rayadito Upland Goose Yellow-bridled Finch White-bellied Seedsnipe We also caught our first glimpse of our home for the next two weeks – the MV Plancius. Formerly a research vessel for the Royal Netherlands Navy, Plancius had been converted to expedition duties. It was amusing and mildly alarming to see this small 105-pax vessel, hidden as it was amongst much larger cruise ships, but we had been assured that its diminutive size allowed it to get into smaller anchorages than the big boys. This proved to be true, though there were other implications of its size that would become clear in time. Plancius is the dark blue one to the right of the big boys. Falklands Part 1 Finally we set sail through the Beagle Channel headed for the Falkland Islands. For me this was terra incognita. My compañeros had both visited the place at the behest of her Majesty, but I got the distinct impression that work had significantly interfered with these birding holidays. Zodiacs were used to transport us to the landings. Inger Vandyke and Andrew Harrison compare notes. After a pleasant day on the back deck getting acquainted with seabirds we made landfall, visiting Grave Cove and West Point Island in West Falkland. Gentoo and Southern Rockhopper Penguins were on their nests, as were masses of Black-browed Albatrosses, and a handful of Magellanic Penguins emerged from their burrows to inspect us. Gentoo Penguin Black-browed Albatross Striated Caracara, a.k.a. Johnny Rook Magellanic Penguin It was an excellent day, though the increasingly stiff wind should have been a clue that all might not be well. And sure enough, as we transited the islands headed for Port Stanley those winds increased to seven on the Beaufort Scale and it emerged that we would be unable to dock at Stanley as the port was closed. Somewhat disappointed, we pushed on through high seas and strong winds on our way to South Georgia. Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main Three full days of seawatching ensued. Along the way we crossed over the Antarctic Convergence and the air temperature dropped significantly, but the hardcore birders still kept watch from the deck while more timid passengers huddled in the lounge. Northern Royal Albatross As we sailed through the Roaring Forties and on into the Furious Fifties another aspect of the Plancius’s size manifested itself. She definitely was bounced around by the wind and seas, and displayed a strong tendency to roll. With our bunks oriented at 90 degrees to the ship’s axis this introduced the novel experience of falling asleep whilst continuously sliding from one end of the bed to the other! But one adapts. Birders at the office. South Georgia Prince Olav Harbour whaling station. Finally we arrived, but the wind that had plagued us was not prepared to relent. Gusts of 40-50 knots\\xa0 meant that our first planned landing in Prince Olav Harbour was converted into a zodiac cruise. We were next due to visit the King Penguin colony on Salisbury Plain. Conditions remained unfavourable so we did some scenic cruising along the coast, but finally the wind relented and we were deposited on a long sand beach with no one to keep us company but a couple of hundred seals and around 200,000 King Penguins. Salisbury Plain We had been warned not to approach within 5 metres of the penguins, but the penguins evidently did not get that memo. They were extremely interested in these novel creatures that had entered their domain, and despite evident disappointment on discovering that we were not edible, they continued to observe us closely. Let’s go meet the new neighbours! This became the pattern for the next few days: sail around a bit, boat into shore, commune with penguins and seals, and move on again. King, Gentoo, Chinstrap, and Macaroni Penguins each had their turn in the starring role, with a strong supporting cast of skuas, petrels, shags, terns and the perky South Georgia Pipit. Elephant Seals! The little black 50kg items are the babies. Gold Harbour. Me and my new friend. Photo by Inger Vandyke. Macaroni Penguins We did make the obligatory stop at Grytviken to view the rusting remains of a massive whale-processing facility that was the final resting place of 175,000 whales and countless seals. And needless to say a fine dram was hoisted at the grave of the master mariner Sir Ernest Shackleton. M/V Plancius and friend, Grytviken Harbour. A small section of the abandoned whale oil processing facility. South towards Antarctica… Too soon our time among the spectacular wildlife of South Georgia came to an end and in high spirits we turned south for the three-day run down to the South Orkney Islands and the Weddell Sea. We were now crossing into the Screaming Sixties, and learning that the seas there truly earned their name. In the teeth of a proper gale – Force 9 and 30-metre swells – the mighty Plancius crawled southwards at a true speed of about seven knots. Sadly, seawatching was curtailed as the decks were made off limits to passengers. On the first night outbound tragedy struck. A fellow passenger had a fall and badly injured his head. Suddenly plans had to change. Antarctica was no longer on the programme as we turned around and headed back to the nearest medical facilities at Port Stanley – three long days away. The ship’s doctor and medical professionals amongst the passengers did their best for the casualty, but after about 24 hours he succumbed to his injuries. We later learned that he was one of three passengers killed on Antarctic cruises that season. Falklands Part 2 Being obliged to continue on to Stanley so the Coroner could conduct an investigation, we were able to see the birds of the East Falklands that we had missed on the first go-around. After a morale-building round of fish and chips at the Victory Bar. A thorough search was conducted. Southern Rockhopper Penguin, KIdney Cove. White-tufted Grebes, East Falkland. Blackish Oystercatcher, New Island. Magellanic Penguins, Saunders Island. We were also able to fit in a few more birdy islands in West Falkland on the way home, inter alia bagging the endemic Cobb’s Wren. Cobb’s Wren, Carcass Island. And just to show that the weather gods have a sense of humour, we had calm seas and warm winds all the way back to Ushuaia. Anthony, Andrew, and Geoffrey. Ezeiza The story would not be complete without a shout-out to this leafy suburb of Buenos Aires close by the airport. Or more properly to the birds therein. I found a handful of new life birds while overnighting on the way down and back, including the remarkably odd Guira Cuckoo. Guira Cuckoo Picazuro Pigeon Chalk-browed Mockingbird Epilogue This was, quite possibly, the trip of a lifetime. The wildlife spectacle of South Georgia is equalled only by the great migration on the Serengeti plains. Add in the remoteness, the arduous conditions, and the limited number of people willing and able to make the trip and it becomes something truly special. Are we sad to have missed standing on the Antarctic continent? Definitely. Are we likely to take another month of our lives and another big pile of cash to do a regain? Flat no to that. Would we recommend it to others? Yes, strongly. But with a quiet talk about the actual risks and the physical requirements to navigate one’s way around a rolling ship a long way from help.

Obviously it was a good day in its own rights, but there was something very satisfying about that nice round milestone number. As there was when I saw my 500 th bird species, my thousandth, and so on. So when 2022 started to look like the year of the great pushback after endless lockdowns, I began to wonder whether it might be possible to hit another milestone: to see 1000 birds in a year. In global birding terms this is not exactly a stretch goal: people have seen as many as 6833 species in a year, but they were younger, and either richer, intending to get richer by self-promotion, heavily sponsored, or all of the above. [i] But for an ordinary bloke of ordinary means, and with 65 years on the odometer, 1000 seemed like a tough but not totally implausible goal. And if it could be done, 2022 looked like the year to do it. The combination of trips long-planned and trips cancelled and rescheduled multiple times due to the pesky virus might just put the number 1000 in play. Can I be one of the immortal 1000?  Rufous-crested Coquette, Waqanki Lodge, Peru, 20 July. 1000 birds – the theory So I checked my records and some trip reports. A decent year in Ontario, allowing for time spent out of the country but no rarity-chasing, should be about 230. Santa Marta Ecuador and La Guajira in Colombia should be good for 250 or so, though with a certain amount of overlap (boreal migrants seen in their wintering grounds and then seen again in Ontario). Ecuador was bound to be good, but how many of those species would be overlaps with Colombia? Birdquest was regularly reporting 600+ species in northern Peru. But with trip reports by bird tour companies, you always have to ask whether that was 600 seen/heard by the guide or a realistic 600? And again, how many of those would be overlaps with Ecuador? The South Atlantic would be epic but there were only about 60-80 species to be had. (Albeit great ones such as my first penguins outside of a zoo). But when I added up the conservative estimates it looked like 1000 was do-able. If all went well… 1000 birds – the execution Which of course it didn’t. Omicron put paid to the January expedition to Colombia, and severely restricted my efforts to get the desired winter birds in Ontario. So no Lapland Longspurs, no Northern Saw-whet Owls, and no Northern Shrikes were seen, though fortunately we were able to get to Algonquin Park in February and notch all the finch specialties as well as the wily and elusive Black-backed Woodpecker. White-winged Crossbill absconds with a prize. Algonquin Provincial Park, 18 Feb 22. Ecuador In March I was off to terra incognita, in the form of Southwest Ecuador . Ecuador is, of course, on my to-do list, but the timing of this particular voyage allowed me to avoid losing a deposit from a cancelled trip. We certainly saw some spectacular bird species including the star of the show, the Jocotoco Antpitta, but the sub-optimal aspect from a 1000-in-a-year perspective is that the Tumbes dry forest ecosystem which is the big attraction of Southwest Ecuador would also feature largely in the Northern Peru trip (about which more later). Jocotoco Antpitta. Reserva Tapichalaca, Zamora-Chinchipe Province, Ecuador, 8 March 22. Travel was possible in March but it was still in the era of heavy Covid protocols, so I had to stay two extra days in Quito to ensure I had a negative PCR test. On the plus side this allowed me to book two day trips. At the Antisana volcano on the first day I managed to see the final one of my three essential South American birds: the iconic and incomparable Andean Condor. It’s just the largest bird of prey in the world, the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight (15kg) and wingspan (3.3metres), able to soar for hours without a single flap of its mighty wings (five hours and over 100 miles without a wing flap in one recent study), roosts and breed at elevations of 3,000 to 5,000 m, … I could go on, but you get the picture. One was pleased. Andean Condor. Reserva Antisana, Ecuador, 12 March 22. Reserva Antisana, with Gabriel Bucheli. Masks were still required on the public footpaths. Back to Ontario A week in Pelee in May helped to tick off most of the usual suspects for Ontario, and even added a couple of life birds (Worm-eating Warbler and White-faced Ibis). The fact that the week turned into a week and a half due to a painfully expensive car repair shall go unmentioned. Acadian Flycatcher, Point Pelee National Park, 11 May 22. White-faced Ibis, Erieau Ontario, 4 May 22. The rest of May and most of June were devoted to working on the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas, so June added a whopping total of four birds to my year list. Peru And then it was July and Northern Peru. My plan had been to work my way down to Peru at some future date, but here again I needed to use up a deposit and by that time we knew enough about the Covid pest to guess that July and August were the months least likely to be feature an outbreak. Birding in the high Andes. Peru was a bit of a slog. An extended trip coupled with the fact that it takes a long time to get there and back meant that I was away from 9 July to 2 August. And there was a lot of marching up and down the hill involved. But it was eminently worth the pain – epic birds in epic numbers in epic scenery. I will save the details for a future post. Cinnamon Screech Owl, Abra Patricia, 17 July 22. Gilded Barbet, ACR Cordillera Escalera, San Martín Province, Peru, 25 Jul 22. August was essentially a non-birding month as I tried to wade through 3000 images from Peru. The only additions to the list were a Loggerhead Shrike on the Napanee Alvar (on the fourth attempt!), plus Grasshopper Sparrow and a Yellow-billed Cuckoo with the North Leeds Birders on Amherst Island. Moosonee September brought along another trip cancelled and rescheduled multiple time: Moosonee and Moose Factory with the Ontario Field Ornithologists. This trip was more about riding the Polar Bear Express and seeing the far north of Ontario than it was about year listing, but to my surprise I did get some very nice additions including LeConte’s Sparrow and Red-necked Phalarope, nabbed a Canvasback to make up for the ones I missed in March by being out of the country, and had a close encounter with my nemesis bird, the Fox Sparrow. Rusty Blackbird in its element. Moosonee Sewage Lagoons, 13 September 22. The Polar Bear Express. Then list went quiet for October. The time at home with Lynn balance needed some reinvestment and I had committed to spending two weeks working for the man. I also needed time to plan for and obsess about the biggest trip of all: Tierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Antarctica. The South Atlantic Odyssey This scheme had been cooked up with old muckers Geoffrey McMullan and Andrew Harrison of the Army Ornithological Society. The extended timeline between booking a place and going on the trip neatly bookended the Covid interlude, and it came to pass that we went, we saw penguins, we returned. It was an amazing wildlife experience which I will eventually write up as a blog post, and it also effectively ended the year of the 1000 bird goal. The only addition before ENDEX was a Tundra Swan seen with Rick Lott and Grant Kaduck on the Kingston Christmas Bird Count. Magellanic Woodpecker. Tierra del Fuego National Park, 21 Nov 22. Magellanic Penguins on the march. Falkland Islands, 8 December 22. So, you might observe, Kaduck has been avoiding the elephant in the room. Did I actually get to 1000 bird species in 2022? 1000 birds? – the results please Well yes. 1121 to be precise, and that’s on the restrictive ebird/Clements taxonomy. So yay for me. 😊 The circumstances of 2022 were unique, so the likelihood of hitting 1000 again seems small. But I’m chalking it up as once of those things, like running a marathon or jumping out of an airplane, that I have experienced and don’t need to aim for again. Granted, a major lottery win might change that perspective, but since I don’t buy lottery tickets the contingency, as Jeeves would say, is remote. Bird #1000 – White-tailed Shrike Tyrant, 29 July 22.

Giganotosaurus [ edit ] Nominator(s): FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:10, 30 September 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] This article is about one of the largest known meat-eating dinosaurs, and therefore one of the largest terrestrial carnivores to have ever existed. The dinosaur is thought to have equalled or even surpassed Tyrannosaurus in length, and the article is one of the most viewed dinosaur articles on Wikipedia. The article contains practically everything ever published about this animal, and covers the scientific debate/competition about the maximum size of theropod dinosaurs. The article is a GA and has been copy-edited. FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:10, 30 September 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments from Jim [ edit ] Very comprehensive and well written, but, of course, some quibbles I appreciate that there need to be some technical terms, but in places they appear unnecessary. How is \"caudal (tail) vertebrae\" better than \"tail vertebrae\" either in style or information content? Please check to see where the text can be made reader-friendlier I swapped the words so the scientific terms for vertebrae are in parenthesis. But for most of the other anatomical terms, the scientific terms are the most used, and using something like \"groove\" instead of sulcus would be too generic (and make the meaning less clear), I think. FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Similarly, if you are going to use technical or mainly US terms, make sure they are linked. I noticed Vertebra, dune buggy and badlands , but there may be others Linked. FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] genus of theropod dinosaur — is this a typo or a hunters' plural as in \"I killed three lion, six tiger and two gigantosaur ? It is supposed to be singular. Like \"is a genus of psittacine parrot\", or some such... FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] honours the discoverer why do we have to read most of the article to find who he is?. Now added to intro, is that what you meant? History is the only place in the article body where that info makes sense. FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] fully devoted — how does this differ from \"devoted\"? Removed.

Cas Liber ( talk · contribs ) 00:34, 5 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Though incompletely known, the skull of Giganotosaurus appears to have been proportionally low. - what does \"proportionally low\" mean? I guess it means in proportion to its length, but the source doesn't specify. I've removed \"proportionally\", better? FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:21, 5 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Having read though, nothing else is jumping out at me...so looking okay really.

It's just the author's university website [2] , should I use the name of the university or something? FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Is Skeletal Drawing a credible source? Scott Hartman is a published palaeontologist [3] , Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources says \"Self-published material may sometimes be acceptable when its author is an established expert whose work in the relevant field has been published by reliable third-party publications.\" FunkMonk ( talk ) 21:20, 31 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I think you need to wiki-link NPR and it's not need italics. Linked, but the italics are added by the template, can't remove them. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] ref 19 - ditto (McFarland & Co.) Linked. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Any reason for writing the full date only in ref 27? Also, if I am not mistaken the date is 26 Sep not 11 Sep. Removed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Wiki-links needed for the following: PLoS ONE (31), Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (34), news.nationalgeographic.com (36; you can simply write it as National Geographic) and Cretaceous Research (37). – Liebe99 ( talk ) 20:19, 31 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Done, though I'm pretty sure this is not a requirement.

FunkMonk ( talk ) 13:55, 1 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments by Mike Christie [ edit ] Generally looks in good shape.  A few comments: \"during the early Cenomanian age, of the Late Cretaceous period\": I don't think you need that comma. Removed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Is the image showing comparisons of size sourced?  I don't see anything indicating the sources when I click through to the file; the details in the history persuade that it is very likely based on sourced data, but I think it should either be sourced here in the article or else in the file. \"Rescued\" this data from another version of the image. [4] FunkMonk ( talk ) 09:52, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Two of the four links given are to Wikipedia users, and one is a broken link.  The other is to a blog, which looks like it might pass RS, but I don't see the specific pages or data given that support the image used here. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] The sizes shown are within the range of what's stated in the cited article text, so I could perhaps add those sources? As noted in the discussion linked below, WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE should secure the use of user-made images. FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"some writers have considered such sizes exaggerated\": this is positioned to make it seem that the scepticism only applies to the second specimen, but since the estimated sizes are barely largely than those estimated for the holotype I'm curious to know if the scepticism applies to both sets of sizes?  If so I'd make that clearer in the text. There has been scepticism about about the largest estimates for both specimens, so I tweaked the text. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:49, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"The maxilla of the upper jaw\": aren't these the same?  I'd think this should be \"The maxilla (upper jaw)\". There is also the premaxilla (which is very small in humans), in front of the maxilla. It makes up a considerable part of the upper jaws in long-snouted animals. FunkMonk ( talk ) 09:43, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Is the restoration sourced?  E.g. is this just a Wikipedian's imagination or can it be shown to represent a reliable source's description?  And the same question for the other two restoration images later in the article. Such restorations are normally drawn after skeletal reconstructions of some kind, but the artists don't always state which exact skeletal image they have based their drawings on. There was some discussion about whether user-made illustrations of dinosaurs were appropriate for Wikipedia [5] , but the conclusion was that these are not considered original research, per WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE , but it is appreciated if sources used are listed in file descriptions. In any case, the images have been under review at the Dinosaur Wiki Project's image review: [6] or on the talk page, and other users, including myself, have made some anatomical tweaks on them. Two of the artists (Dmitry Bogdanov and Nobu Tamura) have illustrated published dinosaur books as well. FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:38, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I haven't run into this before; I'll post on WT:FAC and try to get more opinions.  My feeling is that it's fine for a Wikipedian to make a picture, and it doesn't have to be considered original research, but it should be possible for a reader to understand where the picture came from and why it's reliable.  I don't think that's the case here.  Let's see what others say. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] It was discussed at length at the \"no original research\" talk page [7] , with the consensus mentioned above. So feel free to start a new discussion, but please make clear that it has already been discussed with a favourable outcome, with emphasis on WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE . There was also this lead-up discussion: [8] FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"Though not completely known, it is possible that each dentary had twelve alveoli\": suggest cutting the first four words; I don't think they say anything that \"It is possible\" doesn't say. Snipped. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"along with elements used by palaeontologists during the excavation\": what does \"elements\" mean here? It most likely means equipment, but the source simpy says \"The elements used by paleontologists during the searches are also on display.\" So not sure how much room there is for interpretation here. FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:06, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] If we don't know exactly what it means, I think it should just be cut. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Well, I know from for example this [9] blog post that these \"elements\" are a dune buggy and field tools, but not sure how reliable it is to use as source, though it is rather uncontroversial information. FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Can you use the pictures here to support the description?  The dune buggy shows up there a couple of times, and in at least one shot I can see tools. I know these are user-contributed pictures, but tripadvisor exercises editorial control over what gets displayed, so I think this would count as a reliable source. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:57, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] In that case, this [10] Tripadvisor review specifically states \"El Buggy que utilizaba Ruben Carolini cuando encontró al Dinosaurio mas grande del mundo\". So perhaps better than citing an image? FunkMonk ( talk ) 11:14, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Yes, that's better; I think I'd cite the image too, just to make sure nobody complains about the user-generated nature of the quote. Can't use that for the tools, though, but the buggy is the main point, since it was clearly set up to look like the discovery scene. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 11:17, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"The discussion of what was the largest theropod\": suggest \"The discussion of which theropod was the largest\". Fixed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"would help in understanding of the Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas\": suggest \"would help in the understanding of Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas\". Done. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"Lake Ezquiel Ramos Mexia\": a Google search suggests this might be a typo for \"Ezequiel\". Fixed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"estimates in absolute values like newtons was impossible\": either \"estimating ... was impossible\", or \"estimates ... were impossible\". Took the last option. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] -- Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 00:44, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks for the review, I'll respond later today. FunkMonk ( talk ) 08:55, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I've struck most of the points except the ones about the images; I'll ask at WT:FAC and see what others say. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Per the conversation at WT:FAC , if you can add sources to the other images as well I think that addresses the image issue.  That just leaves the \"elements\" point, which I think we're agreed on but the change is not yet in the article. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 00:05, 10 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Yep, I'll take care of all this later today. FunkMonk ( talk ) 08:54, 10 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Sourced some more of the images, but will finish the rest early next week. Had less time than I expected... FunkMonk ( talk ) 20:31, 10 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I think the Tripadvisor links are maybe a bit iffy, how about using this more official-looking site [11] about that exhibition which says \"it houses bone replicas, lifestyles and tools used by paleontologists\", and replacing the word \"elements\" with \"tools\" in this article? Yes, that would definitely be an improvement. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 18:16, 14 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I have now added that source, added references to restorations, and removed one image that showed grass, as I cannot find any references that state such was found at the time and place this dinosaur lived. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:28, 14 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Support .  Just had a look, and all four of the restoration pictures now have sources; that was my only remaining objection. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 18:43, 14 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks! Good to now have a standard for how to do this in the future.

Painting by Franz Rösel von Rosenhof, public domain/CC0. When I was a child, I had a scrapbook which I filled with pictures of extinct animals, especially dinosaurs. As I was unable to write myself, I asked my mom to copy text from some of my books on the subject, to make the scrapbook look more “real”. I was fascinated by extinct animals, since no one had ever seen them alive, making them almost mythological. I later began drawing my own illustrations of extinct creatures, but by the time I reached my teens, this felt like an “uncool” waste of time. Fast forward to my early twenties, when I began to casually edit Wikipedia articles, and became very impressed by the dinosaur articles there. I discovered that due to Wikipedia’s license policies , many dinosaur articles lacked illustrations, and this rekindled my interest in drawing dinosaurs: now there was a purpose to it! I started posting illustrations to WikiProject Dinosaurs’ image review page , where I got a crash-course in the latest dinosaur research by the local experts. I was surprised by the discoveries that had been made since I stopped paying attention to the field, but I did not feel confident enough in my knowledge to edit the article texts, so I stuck to adding illustrations and photographs, some self-made, and some “scavenged” on the web. One amusing consequence of making free illustrations for Wikipedia was seeing them pop up in unexpected places. I recognised an illustration I made of the dinosaur Segnosaurus on a bootleg poster sold outside a Walking With Dinosaurs arena show, and noticed the same illustration in an exhibit at a Polish museum… Early illustration I made for Wikipedia of Segnosaurus , which popped up on a bootleg poster and in a Polish museum. Restoration by FunkMonk, CC BY-SA 3.0 . As the years went, I became increasingly familiar with the palaeontological literature through my activities on Wikipedia. I started buying books about dinosaurs and other extinct animals again, and I reached a point where I was able to identify unlabelled photos of museum specimens in free Flickr and Wikimedia Commons images, thereby making them useful for Wikipedia. Among the new books I had acquired was one about the extinct dodo . Looking at the bird’s Wikipedia article, I was baffled by the state it was in, considering how famous a species it was. To flesh out the article, I added a few 17th century quotes from travellers who encountered the bird, but the text still didn’t feel worthy of the subject. The following summer, my girlfriend and I broke up, and my holiday plans went out the window. With nothing specific to do, I took a crack at summarising text from my dodo book in the Wikipedia article, mainly to make room for some interesting contemporary illustrations of the bird. After some days I was hooked, and I started to do the same in the article about the related and also extinct Rodrigues solitaire . After having expanded these articles, I got curious about nominating them for good and perhaps featured article status, but as a non-native speaker, I was unsure about the quality of my English writing. With support from editors at WikiProject Birds , the articles were promoted, and I felt encouraged to expand and nominate more articles about recently extinct birds—an otherwise quite neglected subject on Wikipedia, with only two prior featured articles, but also one where sources were easy to come by. After some months, I had successfully nominated articles about most of the charismatic extinct bird fauna of the Mascarene islands, and I then began working my way towards other extinct animals, began co-writing articles with other editors, and finally felt confident enough in my writing to tackle dinosaur articles. I had felt uneasy with this subject because of the great work that had been done before me, so I started with Dromaeosauroides , a rather obscure dinosaur that  nonetheless had sentimental value for me, as it is the only named dinosaur from my home country of Denmark. While writing the article, I also maintained an email correspondence with the palaeontologists who found and named the dinosaur; they gave me input when drawing the illustrations in the article. Velocisaurus. Restoration by FunkMonk, CC BY-SA 3.0 . Since then, writing and nominating Wikipedia articles about extinct animals of all sorts has been a stable hobby of mine, and I feel it is a direct continuation/evolution of the old scrapbook I kept as a kid. In a sense, I feel it is the closest that can be done to bring these animals back to life (short of cloning them, which will never be possible for most). If I really want to stretch my credit, it may even help spread awareness about conservation of living species that are threatened by human activities (many of the animals I’ve written about were exterminated by humans). On a more personal level, it also acts as a substitute to a career in biology; my profession is animation, but natural history has always been a strong passion. I have come the closest to doing scientific research through my research for Wikipedia, including discovering formerly unnoticed (according to palaeontologist Julian Hume ) historical illustrations of extinct birds, such as one in the National Gallery of Denmark showing two white dodos (painting at top) . So in short, Wikipedia reignited my childhood obsession with dinosaurs and other extinct animals. I’m thrilled when I can pass on any of that enthusiasm by improving the articles about them, thereby keeping these creatures alive in the collective memory.

The article was promoted by Ian Rose via FACBot ( talk ) 14:41, 19 November 2016 [1] . Giganotosaurus [ edit ] Nominator(s): FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:10, 30 September 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] This article is about one of the largest known meat-eating dinosaurs, and therefore one of the largest terrestrial carnivores to have ever existed. The dinosaur is thought to have equalled or even surpassed Tyrannosaurus in length, and the article is one of the most viewed dinosaur articles on Wikipedia. The article contains practically everything ever published about this animal, and covers the scientific debate/competition about the maximum size of theropod dinosaurs. The article is a GA and has been copy-edited. FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:10, 30 September 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments from Jim [ edit ] Very comprehensive and well written, but, of course, some quibbles I appreciate that there need to be some technical terms, but in places they appear unnecessary. How is \"caudal (tail) vertebrae\" better than \"tail vertebrae\" either in style or information content? Please check to see where the text can be made reader-friendlier I swapped the words so the scientific terms for vertebrae are in parenthesis. But for most of the other anatomical terms, the scientific terms are the most used, and using something like \"groove\" instead of sulcus would be too generic (and make the meaning less clear), I think. FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Similarly, if you are going to use technical or mainly US terms, make sure they are linked. I noticed Vertebra, dune buggy and badlands , but there may be others Linked. FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] genus of theropod dinosaur — is this a typo or a hunters\\' plural as in \"I killed three lion, six tiger and two gigantosaur ?

FunkMonk ( talk ) 16:14, 3 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] honours the discoverer why do we have to read most of the article to find who he is?. Now added to intro, is that what you meant?

Cas Liber ( talk · contribs ) 00:34, 5 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Though incompletely known, the skull of Giganotosaurus appears to have been proportionally low. - what does \"proportionally low\" mean? I guess it means in proportion to its length, but the source doesn\\'t specify. I\\'ve removed \"proportionally\", better? FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:21, 5 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Having read though, nothing else is jumping out at me...so looking okay really.

LittleJerry ( talk ) 17:03, 15 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Source review please note that I am not spot-checking refs and shall not be returning to strike out my queries ref 1 - since it is an encyclopedia, it needs to be in italics. Done. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] do we know the publisher for ref 6? It\\'s just the author\\'s university website [2] , should I use the name of the university or something? FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Is Skeletal Drawing a credible source? Scott Hartman is a published palaeontologist [3] , Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources says \"Self-published material may sometimes be acceptable when its author is an established expert whose work in the relevant field has been published by reliable third-party publications.\" FunkMonk ( talk ) 21:20, 31 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I think you need to wiki-link NPR and it\\'s not need italics. Linked, but the italics are added by the template, can\\'t remove them. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] ref 19 - ditto (McFarland & Co.) Linked. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Any reason for writing the full date only in ref 27? Also, if I am not mistaken the date is 26 Sep not 11 Sep. Removed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Wiki-links needed for the following: PLoS ONE (31), Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (34), news.nationalgeographic.com (36; you can simply write it as National Geographic) and Cretaceous Research (37). – Liebe99 ( talk ) 20:19, 31 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Done, though I\\'m pretty sure this is not a requirement. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:46, 2 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks, will look at these soon. FunkMonk ( talk ) 21:20, 31 October 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Spot check [ edit ] I\\'ll spot check some refs presently. using this version in case refs are moved Cas Liber ( talk · contribs ) 13:37, 1 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] FN 5 - used twice - material faithful to source FN 33 - used once - material faithful to source FN 37 - used twice - material faithful to source ok I\\'m happy Cas Liber ( talk · contribs ) 13:53, 1 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks! FunkMonk ( talk ) 13:55, 1 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Comments by Mike Christie [ edit ] Generally looks in good shape.  A few comments: \"during the early Cenomanian age, of the Late Cretaceous period\": I don\\'t think you need that comma. Removed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Is the image showing comparisons of size sourced?  I don\\'t see anything indicating the sources when I click through to the file; the details in the history persuade that it is very likely based on sourced data, but I think it should either be sourced here in the article or else in the file. \"Rescued\" this data from another version of the image. [4] FunkMonk ( talk ) 09:52, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Two of the four links given are to Wikipedia users, and one is a broken link.  The other is to a blog, which looks like it might pass RS, but I don\\'t see the specific pages or data given that support the image used here. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] The sizes shown are within the range of what\\'s stated in the cited article text, so I could perhaps add those sources? As noted in the discussion linked below, WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE should secure the use of user-made images. FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"some writers have considered such sizes exaggerated\": this is positioned to make it seem that the scepticism only applies to the second specimen, but since the estimated sizes are barely largely than those estimated for the holotype I\\'m curious to know if the scepticism applies to both sets of sizes?  If so I\\'d make that clearer in the text. There has been scepticism about about the largest estimates for both specimens, so I tweaked the text. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:49, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"The maxilla of the upper jaw\": aren\\'t these the same?  I\\'d think this should be \"The maxilla (upper jaw)\". There is also the premaxilla (which is very small in humans), in front of the maxilla. It makes up a considerable part of the upper jaws in long-snouted animals. FunkMonk ( talk ) 09:43, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Is the restoration sourced?  E.g. is this just a Wikipedian\\'s imagination or can it be shown to represent a reliable source\\'s description?  And the same question for the other two restoration images later in the article. Such restorations are normally drawn after skeletal reconstructions of some kind, but the artists don\\'t always state which exact skeletal image they have based their drawings on. There was some discussion about whether user-made illustrations of dinosaurs were appropriate for Wikipedia [5] , but the conclusion was that these are not considered original research, per WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE , but it is appreciated if sources used are listed in file descriptions. In any case, the images have been under review at the Dinosaur Wiki Project\\'s image review: [6] or on the talk page, and other users, including myself, have made some anatomical tweaks on them. Two of the artists (Dmitry Bogdanov and Nobu Tamura) have illustrated published dinosaur books as well. FunkMonk ( talk ) 17:38, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I haven\\'t run into this before; I\\'ll post on WT:FAC and try to get more opinions.  My feeling is that it\\'s fine for a Wikipedian to make a picture, and it doesn\\'t have to be considered original research, but it should be possible for a reader to understand where the picture came from and why it\\'s reliable.  I don\\'t think that\\'s the case here.  Let\\'s see what others say. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] It was discussed at length at the \"no original research\" talk page [7] , with the consensus mentioned above. So feel free to start a new discussion, but please make clear that it has already been discussed with a favourable outcome, with emphasis on WP:OI and WP:PERTINENCE . There was also this lead-up discussion: [8] FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"Though not completely known, it is possible that each dentary had twelve alveoli\": suggest cutting the first four words; I don\\'t think they say anything that \"It is possible\" doesn\\'t say. Snipped. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"along with elements used by palaeontologists during the excavation\": what does \"elements\" mean here? It most likely means equipment, but the source simpy says \"The elements used by paleontologists during the searches are also on display.\" So not sure how much room there is for interpretation here. FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:06, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] If we don\\'t know exactly what it means, I think it should just be cut. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Well, I know from for example this [9] blog post that these \"elements\" are a dune buggy and field tools, but not sure how reliable it is to use as source, though it is rather uncontroversial information. FunkMonk ( talk ) 10:35, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Can you use the pictures here to support the description?  The dune buggy shows up there a couple of times, and in at least one shot I can see tools. I know these are user-contributed pictures, but tripadvisor exercises editorial control over what gets displayed, so I think this would count as a reliable source. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:57, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] In that case, this [10] Tripadvisor review specifically states \"El Buggy que utilizaba Ruben Carolini cuando encontró al Dinosaurio mas grande del mundo\". So perhaps better than citing an image? FunkMonk ( talk ) 11:14, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Yes, that\\'s better; I think I\\'d cite the image too, just to make sure nobody complains about the user-generated nature of the quote. Can\\'t use that for the tools, though, but the buggy is the main point, since it was clearly set up to look like the discovery scene. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 11:17, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"The discussion of what was the largest theropod\": suggest \"The discussion of which theropod was the largest\". Fixed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"would help in understanding of the Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas\": suggest \"would help in the understanding of Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas\". Done. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"Lake Ezquiel Ramos Mexia\": a Google search suggests this might be a typo for \"Ezequiel\". Fixed. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] \"estimates in absolute values like newtons was impossible\": either \"estimating ... was impossible\", or \"estimates ... were impossible\". Took the last option. FunkMonk ( talk ) 18:36, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] -- Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 00:44, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks for the review, I\\'ll respond later today. FunkMonk ( talk ) 08:55, 8 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I\\'ve struck most of the points except the ones about the images; I\\'ll ask at WT:FAC and see what others say. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 10:18, 9 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] Per the conversation at WT:FAC , if you can add sources to the other images as well I think that addresses the image issue.  That just leaves the \"elements\" point, which I think we\\'re agreed on but the change is not yet in the article.

FunkMonk ( talk ) 20:31, 10 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I think the Tripadvisor links are maybe a bit iffy, how about using this more official-looking site [11] about that exhibition which says \"it houses bone replicas, lifestyles and tools used by paleontologists\", and replacing the word \"elements\" with \"tools\" in this article? Yes, that would definitely be an improvement. Mike Christie ( talk - contribs - library ) 18:16, 14 November 2016 (UTC) [ reply ] I have now added that source, added references to restorations, and removed one image that showed grass, as I cannot find any references that state such was found at the time and place this dinosaur lived.

Painting by Franz Rösel von Rosenhof, public domain/CC0. When I was a child, I had a scrapbook which I filled with pictures of extinct animals, especially dinosaurs. As I was unable to write myself, I asked my mom to copy text from some of my books on the subject, to make the scrapbook look more “real”. I was fascinated by extinct animals, since no one had ever seen them alive, making them almost mythological. I later began drawing my own illustrations of extinct creatures, but by the time I reached my teens, this felt like an “uncool” waste of time. Fast forward to my early twenties, when I began to casually edit Wikipedia articles, and became very impressed by the dinosaur articles there. I discovered that due to Wikipedia’s license policies , many dinosaur articles lacked illustrations, and this rekindled my interest in drawing dinosaurs: now there was a purpose to it! I started posting illustrations to WikiProject Dinosaurs’ image review page , where I got a crash-course in the latest dinosaur research by the local experts. I was surprised by the discoveries that had been made since I stopped paying attention to the field, but I did not feel confident enough in my knowledge to edit the article texts, so I stuck to adding illustrations and photographs, some self-made, and some “scavenged” on the web. One amusing consequence of making free illustrations for Wikipedia was seeing them pop up in unexpected places. I recognised an illustration I made of the dinosaur Segnosaurus on a bootleg poster sold outside a Walking With Dinosaurs arena show, and noticed the same illustration in an exhibit at a Polish museum… Early illustration I\\xa0made for Wikipedia of Segnosaurus , which popped up on a bootleg poster and in a Polish museum. Restoration by FunkMonk, CC BY-SA 3.0 . As the years went, I became increasingly familiar with the palaeontological literature through my activities on Wikipedia. I started buying books about dinosaurs and other extinct animals again, and I reached a point where I was able to identify unlabelled photos of museum specimens in free Flickr and Wikimedia Commons images, thereby making them useful for Wikipedia. Among the new books I had acquired was one about the extinct dodo . Looking at the bird’s Wikipedia article, I was baffled by the state it was in, considering how famous a species it was. To flesh out the article, I added a few 17th century quotes from travellers who encountered the bird, but the text still didn’t feel worthy of the subject. The following summer, my girlfriend and I broke up, and my holiday plans went out the window. With nothing specific to do, I took a crack at summarising text from my dodo book in the Wikipedia article, mainly to make room for some interesting contemporary illustrations of the bird. After some days I was hooked, and I started to do the same in the article about the related and also extinct Rodrigues solitaire . After having expanded these articles, I got curious about nominating them for good and perhaps featured article status, but as a non-native speaker, I was unsure about the quality of my English writing. With support from editors at WikiProject Birds , the articles were promoted, and I felt encouraged to expand and nominate more articles about recently extinct birds—an otherwise quite neglected subject on Wikipedia, with only two prior featured articles, but also one where sources were easy to come by. After some months, I had successfully nominated articles about most of the charismatic extinct bird fauna of the Mascarene islands, and I then began working my way towards other extinct animals, began co-writing articles with other editors, and finally felt confident enough in my writing to tackle dinosaur articles. I had felt uneasy with this subject because of the great work that had been done before me, so I started with Dromaeosauroides , a rather obscure dinosaur\\xa0that\\xa0\\xa0nonetheless had sentimental value for me, as it is the only named dinosaur from my home country\\xa0of Denmark. While writing the article, I also maintained an email correspondence with the palaeontologists who found and named the dinosaur; they gave me input when drawing the illustrations in the article. Velocisaurus. Restoration by FunkMonk, CC BY-SA 3.0 . Since then, writing and nominating Wikipedia articles about extinct animals of all sorts has been a stable hobby of mine, and I feel it is a direct continuation/evolution of the old scrapbook I kept as a kid. In a sense, I feel it is the closest that can be done to bring these animals back to life\\xa0(short of cloning them, which will never be possible for most).\\xa0If I really want to stretch my credit, it may even help spread awareness about conservation of living species that are threatened by human activities (many of the animals I’ve written about were exterminated by humans). On a more personal level, it also acts as a substitute to a career in biology; my profession is animation, but natural history has always been a strong passion. I have come the closest to doing scientific research through my research for Wikipedia, including discovering formerly unnoticed (according to palaeontologist Julian Hume ) historical illustrations of extinct birds, such as one in the National Gallery of Denmark showing two white dodos (painting at top) . So in short, Wikipedia reignited my childhood obsession with dinosaurs and other extinct animals. I’m thrilled when\\xa0I can pass on any of that enthusiasm by improving the articles about them, thereby keeping these creatures alive in the collective memory.

Even better, the quandle is a complete invariant of knots: if two knots have isomorphic quandles, there’s a diffeomorphism of ℝ 3 \\mathbb{R}^3 mapping one knot to the other. I’ve always wondered where the name ‘quandle’ came from.  So I decided to ask their inventor, David Joyce —who also proved the theorem I just mentioned. He replied: I needed a usable word.  “Distributive algebra” had too many syllables. Piffle was already taken. I tried trindle and quagle, but they didn’t seem right, so I went with quandle. So there you go!  Another mystery unraveled. Actually, it turns out my former student Alissa Crans had already asked him this question, and he’d given another answer: I wanted a short term, just one word, that wasn’t taken. I didn’t want to use a common word like group or ring which had a meaning in common English, so I selected a nonsense word. It just sounded good. I was thinking at the time that an alternative would be “conjugacy algebra,” but that was too long, and the word “algebra” suggests that addition and multiplication should be operations, which they aren’t in quandles. Taken together, I hope they add up to the whole story.

In a completely different setting there are operations which behave similarly (they distribute over themselves): weakening and substitution in type theory! Taking an algebraic point of view of what type dependency is, one could model contexts as the objects of a category C C , and families as the morphisms. And then there is a weakening structure which consists of functors W f : C / B → C / A W_f : C/B \\to C/A for any morphism f : A → B f:A\\to B , such that W f / ( h ∘ g ) ∘ W g = W W A ( g ) ∘ W f / h W_f/(h\\circ g)\\circ W_g = W_{W_A(g)}\\circ W_f/h for any f : A → B f:A\\to B , g : D → C g:D\\to C and h : C → B h:C\\to B . This is just a way of saying that weakening distributes over itself, and I also think of it as saying that each W f W_f preserves the weakening structure (on C / B C/B ). Forgetting about all the rest of the structure of type dependency, there is thus a notion of weakening system (which is a category with weakening structure), satisfying the same kind of distributivity as a quandle. And groups with conjugation form an example of such weakening systems. Posted by:\n",

Because W f : C / B → C / A W_f:C/B\\to C/A , and C / B C/B inherits the weakening structure from C C , asking that W f W_f preserves this weakening structure is asking that for any morphism g : h ∘ g → h g : h\\circ g \\to h in C / B C/B , W f W_f commutes with W g W_g in a sense (that it distributes over itself, but I had to take the slices into account).

            "Egbert Rijke on May 21, 2015 10:27 PM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” I’ll try to explain it better. In type theory there are judgments of the form Γ ⊢ A fam \\Gamma\\vdash A fam which say that A A is a family over Γ \\Gamma . That means that when you interpret type theory as an algebraic theory, you have a sort ctx ctx for contexts, and a sort fam fam for families, and an operation ft : fam → ctx ft:fam\\to ctx which says for each family what its context is. Now there’s also context extension ext ext , which is an operation fam → ctx fam\\to ctx ; and ft ft and ext ext behave like codomain and domain, respectively. The rest of the axioms of a category (identity morphisms and identity laws) we get from the type dependency rules too, so this forms a category. This is a simplified perspective on B-systems , which Voevodsky has recently introduced, but he uses infinitely many sorts instead of extension. As in B-systems, there are operations for weakening and substitution, and there is a sort for terms as well. But let’s only focus on weakening. When you weaken a family B B in context Γ \\Gamma by a family A A in the same context Γ \\Gamma , you get a family W A ( B ) W_A(B) in context ext ( A ) ext(A) , which is usually denoted by Γ . A \\Gamma.A . Moreover, the structure of type theory requires that W A W_A is functorial in B B . Since families are going to get interpreted as morphisms in this category, we get a functor W f : C / Y → C / X W_f: C/Y\\to C/X for every f : X → Y f:X\\to Y . This will actually be part of a functor from C → Cat C\\to Cat such that an object X X gets mapped to C / X C/X , but it’s not really neat to say that something is a functor into a two-category. This situation really asks for being treated as a pseudo-functor, but I preferred to stay close to the syntax of type theory. So now we have these categories with weakening structures, and it follows that C / X C/X is also a category with weakening structure for each X X in a category C C with weakening structure. A homomorphism of such gadgets is a functor F : C → D F:C\\to D such that for each morphism f : X → Y f:X\\to Y in C C we get F / X ∘ W f = W F ( f ) ∘ F / Y F/X\\circ W_f= W_{F(f)} \\circ F/Y where F / X : C / X → D / F ( X ) F/X:C/X\\to D/F(X) is given by the arrow-part of F F . So it makes sense to require that each W f C / Y → C / X W_f C/Y\\to C/X is a homomorphism of categories with weakening structure, and this represents one of the properties of weakening in type theory. More precisely, this requirement says that for each morphism g : h ∘ g → h g:h\\circ g\\to h in C / Y C/Y , we have W f / ( h ∘ g ) ∘ W g = W W f ( g ) ∘ W f / h W_f/(h\\circ g)\\circ W_g = W_{W_f(g)}\\circ W_f/h . Let’s just consider a simple case, where h = 1 Y h=1_{Y} and apply it to an object of C / Y C/Y , i.e. an arrow k k into Y Y . Then it says that W f ( W g ( k ) ) = W W f ( g ) ( W f ( k ) ) . W_f(W_g(k)) = W_{W_f(g)}(W_f(k)). So this requirement on weakening says exactly that weakening distributes over itself. So when I saw the law of quandles it reminded me of this :) I worked with Vladimir on this prespective on type theory, and he calls the full interpretation of type dependency in this way E-systems.

This comes about by studying the algebra of elementary embeddings between models of (fragments of) set theory, since many large cardinal axioms are formulated in terms of such elementary embeddings. If M M is a model of (a suitably strong fragment of) set theory, then the elementary embeddings M → M M \\to M admit one binary operation ∘ \\circ given by composition (which forms a monoid), but they also admit another operation ⋅ \\cdot\\,\\, , given* by application. This operation satisfies the left distributive rule j ⋅ ( k ⋅ l ) = ( j ⋅ k ) ⋅ ( j ⋅ l ) j \\cdot (k \\cdot l) = (j \\cdot k) \\cdot (j \\cdot l) simply because an elementary embedding between models of set theory must send application to application! Laver showed that if there is a nontrivial elementary embedding j : V λ → V λ j: V_\\lambda \\to V_\\lambda (where V λ V_\\lambda is the λ \\lambda th von Neumann universe), then the algebra it generates under application is free subject to the left distributive law. And certain finite quotients of this free algebra are called Laver tables . Apparently it was by thinking about these kind of things that Dehornoy first defined the standard ordering on the braid group , so this connection has even been quite fruitful! *To be careful, we can’t apply j j to k k because k k is too big to be a set in M M , so j ⋅ k j\\cdot k needs to be defined by first restricting the domain of k k to be a set, then applying j j , and then taking the union over these restrictions. This superficially relies on the idea that a function is a set of ordered pairs, but I think that reliance is only superficial. Posted by:\n",

This connection turns out to mean that large cardinal axioms are needed to prove some elementary-sounding results about quandles. Over on G+ , David Roberts wrote: Holy cow! There’s a theorem about the unboundedness of a reasonable-looking function ℕ → ℕ \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} whose only known proof uses rank-into-rank embeddings. So what? you say. Well, these give the largest large cardinals we know that do not contradict ZFC! (as far as we know). He cites this comment: Adam Goucher, comment on Does an existence of large cardinals have implications in number theory or combinatorics? , MathOverflow . which says: There’s an extremely elementary theorem whose only known proof relies on the existence of a rank-into-rank cardinal (basically the strongest large cardinal axiom not known to contradict ZFC). Let R n = ℤ / 2 n ℤ R_n = \\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\mathbb{Z} .The n n th Laver table is the unique binary operator ⋆ : R n × R n → R n \\star : R_n \\times R_n \\rightarrow R_n determined by the following conditions: p ⋆ 1 ≡ p + 1 p \\star 1 \\equiv p + 1 p ⋆ ( q ⋆ r ) ≡ ( p ⋆ q ) ⋆ ( p ⋆ r ) p \\star (q \\star r) \\equiv (p \\star q) \\star (p \\star r) Then the function f n ( q ) = 1 ⋆ q f_n(q) = 1 \\star q is obviously periodic with some period P ( n ) P(n) dividing 2 n 2^n .

At least for finite things we have the following: A list, or string, is a free monoid. A bag, or multiset, is a free commutative monoid. An ordered set is a free self-distributive monoid. A set is a free commutative, self-distributive monoid. ordered set : list :: set : multiset.\n",
            "etc. In fact, we don’t need associativity, if we have a left/right identity and self-distributivity we already get associativity: a·(b·c) = (a·b)·(a·c) = ((a·b)·a)·((a·b)·c) = ((a·b)·(a·1))·((a·b)·c) = (a·(b·1))·((a·b)·c) = (a·b)·((a·b)·c) = ((a·b)·1)·((a·b)·c) = (a·b)·(1·c) = (a·b)·c So we can cancel any incidence of an argument in an expression if it already occurs in a further left position, a·b·a·c = a·b·c. So we see we are dealing with ordered sets. I noticed these things some years ago when I wanted an analogue of regular expressions in which matched words were ordered by preference. If we think of the elements of our algebra as operations, we can think of x·y as, “do x, if possible, otherwise do y” (and if y is also not possible the combined operation is considered impossible). The identity would then be an always impossible operation. Posted by:\n",

Your comment is fascinating in a couple of ways.  First, I’d never seen this derivation of associativity for a self-distributive binary operation with a unit: a ⋅ ( b ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( a ⋅ c ) = ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ a ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( a ⋅ 1 ) ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ ( b ⋅ 1 ) ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ 1 ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( 1 ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c \\begin{array}{ccl} a \\cdot (b \\cdot c) &=& (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (a \\cdot c) \\\\\n",

How in the world did you think of this? Second, while I don’t yet understand the relation between ordered sets and free self-distributive monoids, I can’t help but hope that this is related to what Tim Campion said in this discussion about cardinals and self-distributive binary operations… since cardinals are (certain especially nice) well-ordered sets, albeit typically infinite. Posted by: John Baez on June  3, 2015  2:11 AM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” Actually, the identity can be both arrived at or discovered and proven by an automated process that I will describe here. There’s no need for creativity or cleverness. Let S be the set of statements of interest. Here, we’ll take S = {A,B,C,D} with the identities A: x = xe; B: x = ex; C: (xy)z = x(yz) and D: x(yz) = (xy)(xz). Let M be any set of interpretations (or models) for the operations and T: S x M -> 2 the “semantics” function. The homomorphism from the free lattice generated by S to 2^M (which T(s,_) maps each s in S into) is a prime filter generated by a statement which, when expressed in conjunctive normal form, yields a set of CONJECTURES. Now apply your favorite theorem prover to each conjecture. Whatever cannot be proven: find counter-examples, add them to M and re-index. This can be done incrementally. So you can actually just start out with M = {}, or M = a large standard set of automatically generated models. For what follows let a,b,c,d denote the negations respectively of A,B,C,D; denote conjunctions by AB = A and B, disjunctions as A|B = A or B. I won’t describe here the incremental process but the one that’s all-at-once – namely: run down all the tables of sizes 1,2,3,4 on up. Every combination except ABcD and aBCd shows up which immediately yields two conjectures: ABD -> C and BC -> A|D. A theorem prover on ABD -> C yields the desired result. A random model search done in conjunction with a theorem prover for BC -> A|D may have difficulty resolving the issue … thus revealing the unexpected importance of those structures that satisfy BC alone. The conjecture is saying that BC structures tend to want to be either quandles or monoids. Betcha didn’t see that one coming. There is a table of size 5 that resolves the conjecture. I will let you try and find it. Here’s a hint: look up syntactic nonoids and try to characterize the aBD structures. The “semantic lattice” L(S) associated with S = {A, B, C, D} is the free lattice 2^2^S modulo the relation (ABD -> C) = true. This is the one and only non-trivial relation between the identities. Conjectures, counter-examples are created automatically, theorems and proofs and established automatically. This is a Boolean Sieve. Along the way, a second structure is “discovered”, namely, the one just discussed here. In essence, what I just described here is a general framework that automates what mathematicians do. Slap on a natural language generator and it can spruce it up with the narratives, and it can write the book for you too. Posted by:\n",

If you want a more ambitious exercise – one which I’ve already quietly begun to carry out – take ALL the identities of interest in ALL the theories you can think of and throw them all together in the pot. Even better: generate every possible identity up to a given size; using various criteria to “normalize” the set … for instance: the identity a = bb can be replaced by a = aa and aa = bb. Run the process on them all and try to derive the entire taxonomy of modern algebra from it all. In a comment further below I alluded to the fact that the axiomatization for the ternary algebra I used with affine geometry (which contains a quandle structure in it under certain conditions) was derived in part by an automated process. This was the process used. If you do this with arithmetic; you can also find the identities to throw in the pot by starting out with the exhaustive list and systematically winnowing it down.

I’m wondering what sort of algebraic structure we really have here.  Alissa Crans has called a set with a left-distributive binary operation is a left shelf .  We’re starting with a unital left shelf : one that has an element 1 1 with 1 ⋅ a = a = a ⋅ 1 1 \\cdot a = a = a \\cdot 1 . But then Sam C showed that such a thing is also a monoid: the binary operation is associative!  And you’ve shown that it also obeys a b = a a b a b = a a b (though of course you did this as part of simplifying the proof that the binary operation is associative). Taking b = 1 b = 1 , we see a 2 = a a^2 = a so it’s also a monoid where every element is idempotent. Now, I’d really be happy if it were a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent, because this would demystify the law a b c = a b a c a b c = a b a c It would follow simply from a b c = a 2 b c = a b a c a b c = a^2 b c = a b a c In short: any commutative monoid where every element is idempotent is a unital left shelf.  But is the converse true? Can someone deduce the commutative law from the unital left shelf laws?  Or can someone find a counterexample: a noncommutative unital left shelf? To conclude, I still don’t understand what Sam C said about the relation between unital left shelves and ordered sets.  (I’ve been asleep for the last 8 hours.) But a very nice sort of partially ordered set is a inf-semilattice : one where every finite set has a greatest lower bound.  Such a thing is secretly the same as a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent… and so, it gives a unital left shelf. How does this work?  Well, suppose we have an inf-semilattice.  The greatest lower bound of a a and b b is an element a ∨ b a \\vee b .  The greatest lower bound of the empty set is a ‘top’ element ⊤ \\top , greater than equal to all the rest.  And the operation ∨ \\vee is commutative and associative, with ⊤ \\top as unit.  So we get a commutative monoid, and clearly every element is idempotent. Conversely, given a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent, we can define a ≤ b a \\le b to mean ab = a ab = a , and check that this defines an inf-semilattice.

So we might define ordered sets of Xs as an inductive type by saying: An ordered set of Xs is either the empty ordered set {}, or a singleton ordered set {x} where x ∈ X, or the “ordered union” of two ordered sets X·Y. And which must obey the unital left shelf laws: {}·X = X·{} = X X·(Y·Z) = (X·Y)·(X·Z) To see that we are dealing with ordered sets notice that any expression involving the elements of a set S, a unit, and a binary operator obeying the unital left shelf laws has a normal form where each element in the expression appears only once (and the unit doesn’t appear). This is because, as I said before, we can cancel any element which already appears further left. (a·b…·c·d)·x·(e·f…·g·h)·x·(i·j…·k·l) = (a·b…·c·d)·x·(e·f…·g·h)·(i·j…·k·l) and, of course, our (a·b…·c·d),(e·f…·g·h), and (i·j…·k·l) may be empty since we can put the identity in their place if they are. So, for example, the expressions on a free unital left shelf over the Booleans are equal to either 1, T, F, T·F, or F·T. That is, isomorphic to the totally ordered subsets of the Booleans. Sorry about the formatting of my equations, I didn’t figure out how break them up onto separate lines. Posted by:\n",

Last night I emailed James Dolan, and I just read the reply: JB: Did you know this?  Say you have a binary operation that distributes over itself on the left and has an element 1 that’s a left and right unit.  Then it’s associative! JD: not completely sure whether i knew it …. JB: I don’t know what this means, except of course that having such a unit is a weird thing. JD: might it be that it means that you’ve got a semilattice, aka acommutative monoid with all elements idempotent?  self-distributivity (xy)z=(xz)(yz) follows there from idempotence and middle-four\n",
            "exchange: (xy)z = (xy)(zz)=(xz)(yz). so can we get back from “self-distributive with 2-sided unit element” to “semilattice”? hmm, i guess not.  z = 1z = (11)z = (1z)(1z) = zz so indeed any element is idempotent, but there seem to be noncommutative examples.  so the fact that we don’t seem to be getting just semilattices is making me suspect that i didn’t ever completely work this out before …. at first i thought that there were examples involving otto’s law xyz=xz, but that seems to be on the wrong track …. on the other hand, maybe the variety of monoids that you’re getting is precisely lawvere’s “graphic monoids” (satisfying xyx=yx) from that hegelian taco stuff …. which i should probably try to understand\n",

A noncommutative algebra is an associative algebra in which the multiplication is not commutative , that is, for which x y {\\displaystyle xy} does not always equal y x {\\displaystyle yx} ; or more generally an algebraic structure in which one of the principal binary operations is not commutative; one also allows additional structures, e.g. topology or norm , to be possibly carried by the noncommutative algebra of functions. An approach giving deep insight about noncommutative spaces is through operator algebras , that is, algebras of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space . [ 1 ] Perhaps one of the typical examples of a noncommutative space is the \" noncommutative torus \", which played a key role in the early development of this field in 1980s and lead to noncommutative versions of vector bundles , connections , curvature , etc. [ 2 ] Motivation [ edit ] The main motivation is to extend the commutative duality between spaces and functions to the noncommutative setting. In mathematics, spaces , which are geometric in nature, can be related to numerical functions on them. In general, such functions will form a commutative ring . For instance, one may take the ring C ( X ) of continuous complex -valued functions on a topological space X . In many cases ( e.g. , if X is a compact Hausdorff space ), we can recover X from C ( X ), and therefore it makes some sense to say that X has commutative topology . More specifically, in topology, compact Hausdorff topological spaces can be reconstructed from the Banach algebra of functions on the space ( Gelfand–Naimark ). In commutative algebraic geometry , algebraic schemes are locally prime spectra of commutative unital rings ( A. Grothendieck ), and every quasi-separated scheme X {\\displaystyle X} can be reconstructed up to isomorphism of schemes from the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O X {\\displaystyle O_{X}} -modules ( P. Gabriel –A. Rosenberg). For Grothendieck topologies , the cohomological properties of a site are invariants of the corresponding category of sheaves of sets viewed abstractly as a topos (A. Grothendieck). In all these cases, a space is reconstructed from the algebra of functions or its categorified version—some category of sheaves on that space. Functions on a topological space can be multiplied and added pointwise hence they form a commutative algebra; in fact these operations are local in the topology of the base space, hence the functions form a sheaf of commutative rings over the base space. The dream of noncommutative geometry is to generalize this duality to the duality between noncommutative algebras, or sheaves of noncommutative algebras, or sheaf-like noncommutative algebraic or operator-algebraic structures, and geometric entities of certain kinds, and give an interaction between the algebraic and geometric description of those via this duality. Regarding that the commutative rings correspond to usual affine schemes, and commutative C*-algebras to usual topological spaces, the extension to noncommutative rings and algebras requires non-trivial generalization of topological spaces as \"non-commutative spaces\". For this reason there is some talk about non-commutative topology , though the term also has other meanings. Applications in mathematical physics [ edit ] There is an influence of physics on noncommutative geometry. [ 3 ] The fuzzy sphere has been used to study the emergence of conformal symmetry in the 3-dimensional Ising model . [ 4 ] Motivation from ergodic theory [ edit ] Some of the theory developed by Alain Connes to handle noncommutative geometry at a technical level has roots in older attempts, in particular in ergodic theory . The proposal of George Mackey to create a virtual subgroup theory, with respect to which ergodic group actions would become homogeneous spaces of an extended kind, has by now been subsumed. Noncommutative C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras [ edit ] The (formal) duals of non-commutative C*-algebras are often now called non-commutative spaces. This is by analogy with the Gelfand representation , which shows that commutative C*-algebras are dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces .  In general, one can associate to any C*-algebra S a topological space Ŝ ; see spectrum of a C*-algebra . For the duality between localizable measure spaces and commutative von Neumann algebras , noncommutative von Neumann algebras are called non-commutative measure spaces . Noncommutative differentiable manifolds [ edit ] A smooth Riemannian manifold M is a topological space with a lot of extra structure. From its algebra of continuous functions C ( M ), we only recover M topologically. The algebraic invariant that recovers the Riemannian structure is a spectral triple . It is constructed from a smooth vector bundle E over M , e.g. the exterior algebra bundle. The Hilbert space L 2 ( M , E ) of square integrable sections of E carries a representation of C ( M) by multiplication operators, and we consider an unbounded operator D in L 2 ( M , E ) with compact resolvent (e.g. the signature operator ), such that the commutators [ D , f ] are bounded whenever f is smooth. A deep theorem [ 5 ] states that M as a Riemannian manifold can be recovered from this data. This suggests that one might define a noncommutative Riemannian manifold as a spectral triple ( A , H , D ), consisting of a representation of a C*-algebra A on a Hilbert space H , together with an unbounded operator D on H , with compact resolvent, such that [ D , a ] is bounded for all a in some dense subalgebra of A . Research in spectral triples is very active, and many examples of noncommutative manifolds have been constructed. Noncommutative affine and projective schemes [ edit ] In analogy to the duality between affine schemes and commutative rings , we define a category of noncommutative affine schemes as the dual of the category of associative unital rings. There are certain analogues of Zariski topology in that context so that one can glue such affine schemes to more general objects. There are also generalizations of the Cone and of the Proj of a commutative graded ring, mimicking a theorem of Serre on Proj. Namely the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O-modules on a Proj of a commutative graded algebra is equivalent to the category of graded modules over the ring localized on Serre's subcategory of graded modules of finite length; there is also analogous theorem for coherent sheaves when the algebra is Noetherian. This theorem is extended as a definition of noncommutative projective geometry by Michael Artin and J. J. Zhang, [ 6 ] who add also some general ring-theoretic conditions (e.g. Artin–Schelter regularity). Many properties of projective schemes extend to this context. For example, there exists an analog of the celebrated Serre duality for noncommutative projective schemes of Artin and Zhang. [ 7 ] A. L. Rosenberg has created a rather general relative concept of noncommutative quasicompact scheme (over a base category), abstracting Grothendieck's study of morphisms of schemes and covers in terms of categories of quasicoherent sheaves and flat localization functors. [ 8 ] There is also another interesting approach via localization theory, due to Fred Van Oystaeyen , Luc Willaert and Alain Verschoren, where the main concept is that of a schematic algebra . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Invariants for noncommutative spaces [ edit ] Some of the motivating questions of the theory are concerned with extending known topological invariants to formal duals of noncommutative (operator) algebras and other replacements and candidates for noncommutative spaces. One of the main starting points of Alain Connes ' direction in noncommutative geometry is his discovery of a new homology theory associated to noncommutative associative algebras and noncommutative operator algebras, namely the cyclic homology and its relations to the algebraic K-theory (primarily via Connes–Chern character map). The theory of characteristic classes of smooth manifolds has been extended to spectral triples, employing the tools of operator K-theory and cyclic cohomology . Several generalizations of now-classical index theorems allow for effective extraction of numerical invariants from spectral triples. The fundamental characteristic class in cyclic cohomology, the JLO cocycle , generalizes the classical Chern character . Examples of noncommutative spaces [ edit ] In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics,  the symplectic phase space of classical mechanics is deformed into a non-commutative phase space generated by the position and momentum operators . The noncommutative torus , deformation of the function algebra of the ordinary torus, can be given the structure of a spectral triple. This class of examples has been studied intensively and still functions as a test case for more complicated situations. Snyder space [ 11 ] Noncommutative algebras arising from foliations . Examples related to dynamical systems arising from number theory , such as the Gauss shift on continued fractions, give rise to noncommutative algebras that appear to have interesting noncommutative geometries. Connection [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2023 ) In the sense of Connes [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2023 ) A Connes connection is a noncommutative generalization of a connection in differential geometry . It was introduced by Alain Connes , and was later generalized by Joachim Cuntz and Daniel Quillen . Definition [ edit ] Given a right A -module E , a Connes connection on E is a linear map ∇ : E → E ⊗ A Ω 1 A {\\displaystyle \\nabla :E\\to E\\otimes _{A}\\Omega ^{1}A} that satisfies the Leibniz rule ∇ r ( s a ) = ∇ r ( s ) a + s ⊗ d a {\\displaystyle \\nabla _{r}(sa)=\\nabla _{r}(s)a+s\\otimes da} .

For other uses, see Commutative (disambiguation) . Commutative property Type Property Field Algebra Statement A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. Symbolic statement x ∗ y = y ∗ x ∀ x , y ∈ S . {\\displaystyle x*y=y*x\\quad \\forall x,y\\in S.} In mathematics , a binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. Perhaps most familiar as a property of arithmetic, e.g. \"3 + 4 = 4 + 3\" or \"2 × 5 = 5 × 2\" , the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as division and subtraction , that do not have it (for example, \"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3\" ); such operations are not commutative, and so are referred to as noncommutative operations . The idea that simple operations, such as the multiplication and addition of numbers, are commutative was for many centuries implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when new algebraic structures started to be studied. [ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] A binary operation ∗ {\\displaystyle *} on a set S is commutative if x ∗ y = y ∗ x {\\displaystyle x*y=y*x} for all x , y ∈ S {\\displaystyle x,y\\in S} . [ 2 ] An operation that is not commutative is said to be noncommutative . [ 3 ] One says that x commutes with y or that x and y commute under ∗ {\\displaystyle *} if [ 4 ] x ∗ y = y ∗ x . {\\displaystyle x*y=y*x.} So, an operation is commutative if every two elements commute. [ 4 ] An operation is noncommutative if there are two elements such that x ∗ y ≠ y ∗ x . {\\displaystyle x*y\\neq y*x.} This does not exclude the possibility that some pairs of elements commute. [ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative. Commutative operations [ edit ] The addition of vectors is commutative, because a → + b → = b → + a → . {\\displaystyle {\\vec {a}}+{\\vec {b}}={\\vec {b}}+{\\vec {a}}.} Addition and multiplication are commutative in most number systems , and, in particular, between natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , real numbers and complex numbers . This is also true in every field . [ 5 ] Addition is commutative in every vector space and in every algebra . [ 6 ] Union and intersection are commutative operations on sets . [ 7 ] \" And \" and \" or \" are commutative logical operations . [ 8 ] Noncommutative operations [ edit ] Division is noncommutative, since 1 ÷ 2 ≠ 2 ÷ 1 {\\displaystyle 1\\div 2\\neq 2\\div 1} . Subtraction is noncommutative, since 0 − 1 ≠ 1 − 0 {\\displaystyle 0-1\\neq 1-0} . However it is classified more precisely as anti-commutative , since x − y = − ( y − x ) {\\displaystyle x-y=-(y-x)} for every ⁠ x {\\displaystyle x} ⁠ and ⁠ y {\\displaystyle y} ⁠ . Exponentiation is noncommutative, since 2 3 ≠ 3 2 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}\\neq 3^{2}} (see Equation x y = y x . [ 9 ] Some truth functions are noncommutative, since their truth tables are different when one changes the order of the operands. [ 10 ] For example, the truth tables for (A ⇒ B) = (¬A ∨ B) and (B ⇒ A) = (A ∨ ¬B) are A B A ⇒ B B ⇒ A F F T T F T T F T F F T T T T T Function composition is generally noncommutative. [ 11 ] For example, if f ( x ) = 2 x + 1 {\\displaystyle f(x)=2x+1} and g ( x ) = 3 x + 7 {\\displaystyle g(x)=3x+7} . Then ( f ∘ g ) ( x ) = f ( g ( x ) ) = 2 ( 3 x + 7 ) + 1 = 6 x + 15 {\\displaystyle (f\\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))=2(3x+7)+1=6x+15} and ( g ∘ f ) ( x ) = g ( f ( x ) ) = 3 ( 2 x + 1 ) + 7 = 6 x + 10. {\\displaystyle (g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=3(2x+1)+7=6x+10.} Matrix multiplication of square matrices of a given dimension is a noncommutative operation, except for ⁠ 1 × 1 {\\displaystyle 1\\times 1} ⁠ matrices. For example: [ 12 ] [ 0 2 0 1 ] = [ 1 1 0 1 ] [ 0 1 0 1 ] ≠ [ 0 1 0 1 ] [ 1 1 0 1 ] = [ 0 1 0 1 ] {\\displaystyle {\\begin{bmatrix}0&2\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}}={\\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}}{\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}}\\neq {\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}}{\\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}}={\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\0&1\\end{bmatrix}}} The vector product (or cross product ) of two vectors in three dimensions is anti-commutative ; i.e., b × a = − ( a × b ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {b} \\times \\mathbf {a} =-(\\mathbf {a} \\times \\mathbf {b} )} . [ 13 ] Commutative structures [ edit ] Some types of algebraic structures involve an operation that does not require commutativity. If this operation is commutative for a specific structure, the structure is often said to be commutative . So, a commutative semigroup is a semigroup whose operation is commutative; [ 14 ] a commutative monoid is a monoid whose operation is commutative; [ 15 ] a commutative group or abelian group is a group whose operation is commutative; [ 16 ] a commutative ring is a ring whose multiplication is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.) [ 17 ] However, in the case of algebras , the phrase \" commutative algebra \" refers only to associative algebras that have a commutative multiplication. [ 18 ] History and etymology [ edit ] Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times. The Egyptians used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products . [ 19 ] Euclid is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book Elements . [ 20 ] Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions. Nowadays, the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics. [ 2 ] The first known use of the term was in a French Journal published in 1814 The first recorded use of the term commutative was in a memoir by François Servois in 1814, which used the word commutatives when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property. [ 21 ] Commutative is the feminine form of the French adjective commutatif , which is derived from the French noun commutation and the French verb commuter , meaning \"to exchange\" or \"to switch\", a cognate of to commute . The term then appeared in English in 1838. in Duncan Gregory 's article entitled \"On the real nature of symbolical algebra\" published in 1840 in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh .

Even better, the quandle is a complete invariant of knots: if two knots have isomorphic quandles, there’s a diffeomorphism of ℝ 3 \\\\mathbb{R}^3 mapping one knot to the other. I’ve always wondered where the name ‘quandle’ came from.  So I decided to ask their inventor, David Joyce —who also proved the theorem I just mentioned. He replied: I needed a usable word.  “Distributive algebra” had too many syllables. Piffle was already taken. I tried trindle and quagle, but they didn’t seem right, so I went with quandle. So there you go!  Another mystery unraveled. Actually, it turns out my former student Alissa Crans had already asked him this question, and he’d given another answer: I wanted a short term, just one word, that wasn’t taken. I didn’t want to use a common word like group or ring which had a meaning in common English, so I selected a nonsense word. It just sounded good. I was thinking at the time that an alternative would be “conjugacy algebra,” but that was too long, and the word “algebra” suggests that addition and multiplication should be operations, which they aren’t in quandles. Taken together, I hope they add up to the whole story.

In a completely different setting there are operations which behave similarly (they distribute over themselves): weakening and substitution in type theory! Taking an algebraic point of view of what type dependency is, one could model contexts as the objects of a category C C , and families as the morphisms. And then there is a weakening structure which consists of functors W f : C / B → C / A W_f : C/B \\\\to C/A for any morphism f : A → B f:A\\\\to B , such that W f / ( h ∘ g ) ∘ W g = W W A ( g ) ∘ W f / h W_f/(h\\\\circ g)\\\\circ W_g = W_{W_A(g)}\\\\circ W_f/h for any f : A → B f:A\\\\to B , g : D → C g:D\\\\to C and h : C → B h:C\\\\to B . This is just a way of saying that weakening distributes over itself, and I also think of it as saying that each W f W_f preserves the weakening structure (on C / B C/B ). Forgetting about all the rest of the structure of type dependency, there is thus a notion of weakening system (which is a category with weakening structure), satisfying the same kind of distributivity as a quandle. And groups with conjugation form an example of such weakening systems.

But this is very interesting.  If you explain it, we could perhaps create some topological invariant from a category with weakening structure.  Even if not all the quandle axioms hold, there are things you can do with just self-distributivity. Knotty logic! Posted by: John Baez on May 21, 2015 10:06 PM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” Hm, sorry. if F F is a functor from C C to D D and X X is an object of C C , then I meant by F / X F/X the functor F / X : C / X → D / F ( X ) F/X:C/X\\\\to D/F(X) (which does what F F does on the arrows). Because W f : C / B → C / A W_f:C/B\\\\to C/A , and C / B C/B inherits the weakening structure from C C , asking that W f W_f preserves this weakening structure is asking that for any morphism g : h ∘ g → h g : h\\\\circ g \\\\to h in C / B C/B , W f W_f commutes with W g W_g in a sense (that it distributes over itself, but I had to take the slices into account). Posted by:\\nEgbert Rijke on May 21, 2015 10:27 PM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” I’ll try to explain it better. In type theory there are judgments of the form Γ ⊢ A fam \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash A fam which say that A A is a family over Γ \\\\Gamma . That means that when you interpret type theory as an algebraic theory, you have a sort ctx ctx for contexts, and a sort fam fam for families, and an operation ft : fam → ctx ft:fam\\\\to ctx which says for each family what its context is. Now there’s also context extension ext ext , which is an operation fam → ctx fam\\\\to ctx ; and ft ft and ext ext behave like codomain and domain, respectively. The rest of the axioms of a category (identity morphisms and identity laws) we get from the type dependency rules too, so this forms a category. This is a simplified perspective on B-systems , which Voevodsky has recently introduced, but he uses infinitely many sorts instead of extension. As in B-systems, there are operations for weakening and substitution, and there is a sort for terms as well. But let’s only focus on weakening. When you weaken a family B B in context Γ \\\\Gamma by a family A A in the same context Γ \\\\Gamma , you get a family W A ( B ) W_A(B) in context ext ( A ) ext(A) , which is usually denoted by Γ . A \\\\Gamma.A . Moreover, the structure of type theory requires that W A W_A is functorial in B B . Since families are going to get interpreted as morphisms in this category, we get a functor W f : C / Y → C / X W_f: C/Y\\\\to C/X for every f : X → Y f:X\\\\to Y . This will actually be part of a functor from C → Cat C\\\\to Cat such that an object X X gets mapped to C / X C/X , but it’s not really neat to say that something is a functor into a two-category. This situation really asks for being treated as a pseudo-functor, but I preferred to stay close to the syntax of type theory. So now we have these categories with weakening structures, and it follows that C / X C/X is also a category with weakening structure for each X X in a category C C with weakening structure. A homomorphism of such gadgets is a functor F : C → D F:C\\\\to D such that for each morphism f : X → Y f:X\\\\to Y in C C we get F / X ∘ W f = W F ( f ) ∘ F / Y F/X\\\\circ W_f= W_{F(f)} \\\\circ F/Y where F / X : C / X → D / F ( X ) F/X:C/X\\\\to D/F(X) is given by the arrow-part of F F . So it makes sense to require that each W f C / Y → C / X W_f C/Y\\\\to C/X is a homomorphism of categories with weakening structure, and this represents one of the properties of weakening in type theory. More precisely, this requirement says that for each morphism g : h ∘ g → h g:h\\\\circ g\\\\to h in C / Y C/Y , we have W f / ( h ∘ g ) ∘ W g = W W f ( g ) ∘ W f / h W_f/(h\\\\circ g)\\\\circ W_g = W_{W_f(g)}\\\\circ W_f/h . Let’s just consider a simple case, where h = 1 Y h=1_{Y} and apply it to an object of C / Y C/Y , i.e. an arrow k k into Y Y . Then it says that W f ( W g ( k ) ) = W W f ( g ) ( W f ( k ) ) . W_f(W_g(k)) = W_{W_f(g)}(W_f(k)). So this requirement on weakening says exactly that weakening distributes over itself. So when I saw the law of quandles it reminded me of this :) I worked with Vladimir on this prespective on type theory, and he calls the full interpretation of type dependency in this way E-systems.

Posted by: Gavin Wraith on May 24, 2015 11:25 AM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” And yet another place where self-distributive binary operations come up is in large cardinal axioms! This comes about by studying the algebra of elementary embeddings between models of (fragments of) set theory, since many large cardinal axioms are formulated in terms of such elementary embeddings. If M M is a model of (a suitably strong fragment of) set theory, then the elementary embeddings M → M M \\\\to M admit one binary operation ∘ \\\\circ given by composition (which forms a monoid), but they also admit another operation ⋅ \\\\cdot\\\\,\\\\, , given* by application. This operation satisfies the left distributive rule j ⋅ ( k ⋅ l ) = ( j ⋅ k ) ⋅ ( j ⋅ l ) j \\\\cdot (k \\\\cdot l) = (j \\\\cdot k) \\\\cdot (j \\\\cdot l) simply because an elementary embedding between models of set theory must send application to application! Laver showed that if there is a nontrivial elementary embedding j : V λ → V λ j: V_\\\\lambda \\\\to V_\\\\lambda (where V λ V_\\\\lambda is the λ \\\\lambda th von Neumann universe), then the algebra it generates under application is free subject to the left distributive law. And certain finite quotients of this free algebra are called Laver tables . Apparently it was by thinking about these kind of things that Dehornoy first defined the standard ordering on the braid group , so this connection has even been quite fruitful! *To be careful, we can’t apply j j to k k because k k is too big to be a set in M M , so j ⋅ k j\\\\cdot k needs to be defined by first restricting the domain of k k to be a set, then applying j j , and then taking the union over these restrictions. This superficially relies on the idea that a function is a set of ordered pairs, but I think that reliance is only superficial. Posted by:\\nTim Campion on May 22, 2015 12:51 AM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” Thanks, Tim!  This connection turns out to mean that large cardinal axioms are needed to prove some elementary-sounding results about quandles. Over on G+ , David Roberts wrote: Holy cow! There’s a theorem about the unboundedness of a reasonable-looking function ℕ → ℕ \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} whose only known proof uses rank-into-rank embeddings. So what? you say. Well, these give the largest large cardinals we know that do not contradict ZFC! (as far as we know). He cites this comment: Adam Goucher, comment on Does an existence of large cardinals have implications in number theory or combinatorics? , MathOverflow . which says: There’s an extremely elementary theorem whose only known proof relies on the existence of a rank-into-rank cardinal (basically the strongest large cardinal axiom not known to contradict ZFC). Let R n = ℤ / 2 n ℤ R_n = \\\\mathbb{Z}/2^n\\\\mathbb{Z} .The n n th Laver table is the unique binary operator ⋆ : R n × R n → R n \\\\star : R_n \\\\times R_n \\\\rightarrow R_n determined by the following conditions: p ⋆ 1 ≡ p + 1 p \\\\star 1 \\\\equiv p + 1 p ⋆ ( q ⋆ r ) ≡ ( p ⋆ q ) ⋆ ( p ⋆ r ) p \\\\star (q \\\\star r) \\\\equiv (p \\\\star q) \\\\star (p \\\\star r) Then the function f n ( q ) = 1 ⋆ q f_n(q) = 1 \\\\star q is obviously periodic with some period P ( n ) P(n) dividing 2 n 2^n . The existence of a rank-into-rank cardinal implies that P ( n ) P(n) grows without bound.

At least for finite things we have the following: A list, or string, is a free monoid. A bag, or multiset, is a free commutative monoid. An ordered set is a free self-distributive monoid. A set is a free commutative, self-distributive monoid. ordered set : list :: set : multiset.\\netc. In fact, we don’t need associativity, if we have a left/right identity and self-distributivity we already get associativity: a·(b·c) = (a·b)·(a·c) = ((a·b)·a)·((a·b)·c) = ((a·b)·(a·1))·((a·b)·c) = (a·(b·1))·((a·b)·c) = (a·b)·((a·b)·c) = ((a·b)·1)·((a·b)·c) = (a·b)·(1·c) = (a·b)·c So we can cancel any incidence of an argument in an expression if it already occurs in a further left position, a·b·a·c = a·b·c. So we see we are dealing with ordered sets. I noticed these things some years ago when I wanted an analogue of regular expressions in which matched words were ordered by preference. If we think of the elements of our algebra as operations, we can think of x·y as, “do x, if possible, otherwise do y” (and if y is also not possible the combined operation is considered impossible). The identity would then be an always impossible operation.

Your comment is fascinating in a couple of ways.  First, I’d never seen this derivation of associativity for a self-distributive binary operation with a unit: a ⋅ ( b ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( a ⋅ c ) = ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ a ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( a ⋅ 1 ) ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ ( b ⋅ 1 ) ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ 1 ) ⋅ ( ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ ( 1 ⋅ c ) = ( a ⋅ b ) ⋅ c \\\\begin{array}{ccl} a \\\\cdot (b \\\\cdot c) &=& (a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot (a \\\\cdot c) \\\\\\\\\\n&=& ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot a) \\\\cdot ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c) \\\\\\\\\\n&=& ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot (a \\\\cdot 1)) \\\\cdot ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c) \\\\\\\\ &=& (a \\\\cdot (b \\\\cdot 1)) \\\\cdot ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c) \\\\\\\\ &=& (a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c) \\\\\\\\ &=& ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot 1) \\\\cdot ((a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c)\\\\\\\\  &=& (a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot (1 \\\\cdot c) \\\\\\\\ &=& (a \\\\cdot b) \\\\cdot c \\\\end{array} I’ll have to stare at this a few days to make sure it’s not a trick. How in the world did you think of this? Second, while I don’t yet understand the relation between ordered sets and free self-distributive monoids, I can’t help but hope that this is related to what Tim Campion said in this discussion about cardinals and self-distributive binary operations… since cardinals are (certain especially nice) well-ordered sets, albeit typically infinite. Posted by: John Baez on June  3, 2015  2:11 AM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” Actually, the identity can be both arrived at or discovered and proven by an automated process that I will describe here. There’s no need for creativity or cleverness. Let S be the set of statements of interest. Here, we’ll take S = {A,B,C,D} with the identities A: x = xe; B: x = ex; C: (xy)z = x(yz) and D: x(yz) = (xy)(xz). Let M be any set of interpretations (or models) for the operations and T: S x M -> 2 the “semantics” function. The homomorphism from the free lattice generated by S to 2^M (which T(s,_) maps each s in S into) is a prime filter generated by a statement which, when expressed in conjunctive normal form, yields a set of CONJECTURES. Now apply your favorite theorem prover to each conjecture. Whatever cannot be proven: find counter-examples, add them to M and re-index. This can be done incrementally. So you can actually just start out with M = {}, or M = a large standard set of automatically generated models. For what follows let a,b,c,d denote the negations respectively of A,B,C,D; denote conjunctions by AB = A and B, disjunctions as A|B = A or B. I won’t describe here the incremental process but the one that’s all-at-once – namely: run down all the tables of sizes 1,2,3,4 on up. Every combination except ABcD and aBCd shows up which immediately yields two conjectures: ABD -> C and BC -> A|D. A theorem prover on ABD -> C yields the desired result. A random model search done in conjunction with a theorem prover for BC -> A|D may have difficulty resolving the issue … thus revealing the unexpected importance of those structures that satisfy BC alone. The conjecture is saying that BC structures tend to want to be either quandles or monoids. Betcha didn’t see that one coming. There is a table of size 5 that resolves the conjecture. I will let you try and find it. Here’s a hint: look up syntactic nonoids and try to characterize the aBD structures. The “semantic lattice” L(S) associated with S = {A, B, C, D} is the free lattice 2^2^S modulo the relation (ABD -> C) = true. This is the one and only non-trivial relation between the identities. Conjectures, counter-examples are created automatically, theorems and proofs and established automatically. This is a Boolean Sieve. Along the way, a second structure is “discovered”, namely, the one just discussed here. In essence, what I just described here is a general framework that automates what mathematicians do. Slap on a natural language generator and it can spruce it up with the narratives, and it can write the book for you too.

If you want a more ambitious exercise – one which I’ve already quietly begun to carry out – take ALL the identities of interest in ALL the theories you can think of and throw them all together in the pot. Even better: generate every possible identity up to a given size; using various criteria to “normalize” the set … for instance: the identity a = bb can be replaced by a = aa and aa = bb. Run the process on them all and try to derive the entire taxonomy of modern algebra from it all. In a comment further below I alluded to the fact that the axiomatization for the ternary algebra I used with affine geometry (which contains a quandle structure in it under certain conditions) was derived in part by an automated process. This was the process used. If you do this with arithmetic; you can also find the identities to throw in the pot by starting out with the exhaustive list and systematically winnowing it down.

I’m wondering what sort of algebraic structure we really have here.  Alissa Crans has called a set with a left-distributive binary operation is a left shelf .  We’re starting with a unital left shelf : one that has an element 1 1 with 1 ⋅ a = a = a ⋅ 1 1 \\\\cdot a = a = a \\\\cdot 1 . But then Sam C showed that such a thing is also a monoid: the binary operation is associative!  And you’ve shown that it also obeys a b = a a b a b = a a b (though of course you did this as part of simplifying the proof that the binary operation is associative). Taking b = 1 b = 1 , we see a 2 = a a^2 = a so it’s also a monoid where every element is idempotent. Now, I’d really be happy if it were a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent, because this would demystify the law a b c = a b a c a b c = a b a c It would follow simply from a b c = a 2 b c = a b a c a b c = a^2 b c = a b a c In short: any commutative monoid where every element is idempotent is a unital left shelf.  But is the converse true? Can someone deduce the commutative law from the unital left shelf laws?  Or can someone find a counterexample: a noncommutative unital left shelf? To conclude, I still don’t understand what Sam C said about the relation between unital left shelves and ordered sets.  (I’ve been asleep for the last 8 hours.) But a very nice sort of partially ordered set is a inf-semilattice : one where every finite set has a greatest lower bound.  Such a thing is secretly the same as a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent… and so, it gives a unital left shelf. How does this work?  Well, suppose we have an inf-semilattice.  The greatest lower bound of a a and b b is an element a ∨ b a \\\\vee b .  The greatest lower bound of the empty set is a ‘top’ element ⊤ \\\\top , greater than equal to all the rest.  And the operation ∨ \\\\vee is commutative and associative, with ⊤ \\\\top as unit.  So we get a commutative monoid, and clearly every element is idempotent. Conversely, given a commutative monoid where every element is idempotent, we can define a ≤ b a \\\\le b to mean ab = a ab = a , and check that this defines an inf-semilattice.

I am glad that you found my comment interesting. “I still don’t understand what Sam C said about the relation between unital left shelves and ordered sets.” I did not state what I meant very well.\\nHere is the nLab page on lists and free monoids: http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/free+monoid Adapting this to the case of unital left shelves: Given a set S, the free unital left shelf on S is the set of all subsets of elements of S with a total ordering on their elements. So we might define ordered sets of Xs as an inductive type by saying: An ordered set of Xs is either the empty ordered set {}, or a singleton ordered set {x} where x ∈ X, or the “ordered union” of two ordered sets X·Y. And which must obey the unital left shelf laws: {}·X = X·{} = X X·(Y·Z) = (X·Y)·(X·Z) To see that we are dealing with ordered sets notice that any expression involving the elements of a set S, a unit, and a binary operator obeying the unital left shelf laws has a normal form where each element in the expression appears only once (and the unit doesn’t appear). This is because, as I said before, we can cancel any element which already appears further left. (a·b…·c·d)·x·(e·f…·g·h)·x·(i·j…·k·l) = (a·b…·c·d)·x·(e·f…·g·h)·(i·j…·k·l) and, of course, our (a·b…·c·d),(e·f…·g·h), and (i·j…·k·l) may be empty since we can put the identity in their place if they are. So, for example, the expressions on a free unital left shelf over the Booleans are equal to either 1, T, F, T·F, or F·T. That is, isomorphic to the totally ordered subsets of the Booleans. Sorry about the formatting of my equations, I didn’t figure out how break them up onto separate lines.

Posted by:\\nSam C on June  3, 2015  9:45 PM | Permalink | Reply to this Re: The Origin of the Word “Quandle” Apparently there are noncommutative unital left shelves.  Last night I emailed James Dolan, and I just read the reply: JB: Did you know this?  Say you have a binary operation that distributes over itself on the left and has an element 1 that’s a left and right unit.  Then it’s associative! JD: not completely sure whether i knew it …. JB: I don’t know what this means, except of course that having such a unit is a weird thing. JD: might it be that it means that you’ve got a semilattice, aka acommutative monoid with all elements idempotent?  self-distributivity (xy)z=(xz)(yz) follows there from idempotence and middle-four\\nexchange: (xy)z = (xy)(zz)=(xz)(yz). so can we get back from “self-distributive with 2-sided unit element” to “semilattice”? hmm, i guess not.  z = 1z = (11)z = (1z)(1z) = zz so indeed any element is idempotent, but there seem to be noncommutative examples.  so the fact that we don’t seem to be getting just semilattices is making me suspect that i didn’t ever completely work this out before …. at first i thought that there were examples involving otto’s law xyz=xz, but that seems to be on the wrong track …. on the other hand, maybe the variety of monoids that you’re getting is precisely lawvere’s “graphic monoids” (satisfying xyx=yx) from that hegelian taco stuff …. which i should probably try to understand\\nsometime, not having understood too much about it back when he talked about it at buffalo …. i vaguely suspect that it’s one of those sorts of things that i didn’t have the prerequisite mind-frame for back then, but might make perfect sense now …. hmm, particularly if there really is some nontrivial relationship to coxeter groups as some of the google links seem to be hinting …. hmm, i wonder if the murphy monoid is a graphic monoid ….. The Murphy monoid is discussed here: James Dolan and Todd Trimble, Buildings and BN-pairs . and the Hegelian taco is discussed here: F. William Lawvere, Display of graphics and their applications, as exemplified by 2-categories and the Hegelian “taco”, Proceedings of the First International Conference on Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology , University of Iowa, May 22-24 1989, Iowa City pp. 51–74. Someone should put this latter paper online—I’ve never read it!  I think it contains a 2-categorical diagram shaped like a taco; on the n n Lab it’s summarized thus: contains the most explicit expression of Hegelian concepts in the context of the presheaf topos on Δ 1 \\\\Delta_1 and a footnote on Lawvere’s relation to Hegelian idealism.

A noncommutative algebra is an associative algebra in which the multiplication is not commutative , that is, for which x y {\\\\displaystyle xy} does not always equal y x {\\\\displaystyle yx} ; or more generally an algebraic structure in which one of the principal binary operations is not commutative; one also allows additional structures, e.g. topology or norm , to be possibly carried by the noncommutative algebra of functions. An approach giving deep insight about noncommutative spaces is through operator algebras , that is, algebras of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space . [ 1 ] Perhaps one of the typical examples of a noncommutative space is the \" noncommutative torus \", which played a key role in the early development of this field in 1980s and lead to noncommutative versions of vector bundles , connections , curvature , etc. [ 2 ] Motivation [ edit ] The main motivation is to extend the commutative duality between spaces and functions to the noncommutative setting. In mathematics, spaces , which are geometric in nature, can be related to numerical functions on them. In general, such functions will form a commutative ring . For instance, one may take the ring C ( X ) of continuous complex -valued functions on a topological space X . In many cases ( e.g. , if X is a compact Hausdorff space ), we can recover X from C ( X ), and therefore it makes some sense to say that X has commutative topology . More specifically, in topology, compact Hausdorff topological spaces can be reconstructed from the Banach algebra of functions on the space ( Gelfand–Naimark ). In commutative algebraic geometry , algebraic schemes are locally prime spectra of commutative unital rings ( A. Grothendieck ), and every quasi-separated scheme X {\\\\displaystyle X} can be reconstructed up to isomorphism of schemes from the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O X {\\\\displaystyle O_{X}} -modules ( P. Gabriel –A. Rosenberg). For Grothendieck topologies , the cohomological properties of a site are invariants of the corresponding category of sheaves of sets viewed abstractly as a topos (A. Grothendieck). In all these cases, a space is reconstructed from the algebra of functions or its categorified version—some category of sheaves on that space. Functions on a topological space can be multiplied and added pointwise hence they form a commutative algebra; in fact these operations are local in the topology of the base space, hence the functions form a sheaf of commutative rings over the base space. The dream of noncommutative geometry is to generalize this duality to the duality between noncommutative algebras, or sheaves of noncommutative algebras, or sheaf-like noncommutative algebraic or operator-algebraic structures, and geometric entities of certain kinds, and give an interaction between the algebraic and geometric description of those via this duality. Regarding that the commutative rings correspond to usual affine schemes, and commutative C*-algebras to usual topological spaces, the extension to noncommutative rings and algebras requires non-trivial generalization of topological spaces as \"non-commutative spaces\". For this reason there is some talk about non-commutative topology , though the term also has other meanings. Applications in mathematical physics [ edit ] There is an influence of physics on noncommutative geometry. [ 3 ] The fuzzy sphere has been used to study the emergence of conformal symmetry in the 3-dimensional Ising model . [ 4 ] Motivation from ergodic theory [ edit ] Some of the theory developed by Alain Connes to handle noncommutative geometry at a technical level has roots in older attempts, in particular in ergodic theory . The proposal of George Mackey to create a virtual subgroup theory, with respect to which ergodic group actions would become homogeneous spaces of an extended kind, has by now been subsumed. Noncommutative C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras [ edit ] The (formal) duals of non-commutative C*-algebras are often now called non-commutative spaces. This is by analogy with the Gelfand representation , which shows that commutative C*-algebras are dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces .  In general, one can associate to any C*-algebra S a topological space Ŝ ; see spectrum of a C*-algebra . For the duality between localizable measure spaces and commutative von Neumann algebras , noncommutative von Neumann algebras are called non-commutative measure spaces . Noncommutative differentiable manifolds [ edit ] A smooth Riemannian manifold M is a topological space with a lot of extra structure. From its algebra of continuous functions C ( M ), we only recover M topologically. The algebraic invariant that recovers the Riemannian structure is a spectral triple . It is constructed from a smooth vector bundle E over M , e.g. the exterior algebra bundle. The Hilbert space L 2 ( M , E ) of square integrable sections of E carries a representation of C ( M) by multiplication operators, and we consider an unbounded operator D in L 2 ( M , E ) with compact resolvent (e.g. the signature operator ), such that the commutators [ D , f ] are bounded whenever f is smooth. A deep theorem [ 5 ] states that M as a Riemannian manifold can be recovered from this data. This suggests that one might define a noncommutative Riemannian manifold as a spectral triple ( A , H , D ), consisting of a representation of a C*-algebra A on a Hilbert space H , together with an unbounded operator D on H , with compact resolvent, such that [ D , a ] is bounded for all a in some dense subalgebra of A . Research in spectral triples is very active, and many examples of noncommutative manifolds have been constructed. Noncommutative affine and projective schemes [ edit ] In analogy to the duality between affine schemes and commutative rings , we define a category of noncommutative affine schemes as the dual of the category of associative unital rings. There are certain analogues of Zariski topology in that context so that one can glue such affine schemes to more general objects. There are also generalizations of the Cone and of the Proj of a commutative graded ring, mimicking a theorem of Serre on Proj. Namely the category of quasicoherent sheaves of O-modules on a Proj of a commutative graded algebra is equivalent to the category of graded modules over the ring localized on Serre\\'s subcategory of graded modules of finite length; there is also analogous theorem for coherent sheaves when the algebra is Noetherian. This theorem is extended as a definition of noncommutative projective geometry by Michael Artin and J. J. Zhang, [ 6 ] who add also some general ring-theoretic conditions (e.g. Artin–Schelter regularity). Many properties of projective schemes extend to this context. For example, there exists an analog of the celebrated Serre duality for noncommutative projective schemes of Artin and Zhang. [ 7 ] A. L. Rosenberg has created a rather general relative concept of noncommutative quasicompact scheme (over a base category), abstracting Grothendieck\\'s study of morphisms of schemes and covers in terms of categories of quasicoherent sheaves and flat localization functors. [ 8 ] There is also another interesting approach via localization theory, due to Fred Van Oystaeyen , Luc Willaert and Alain Verschoren, where the main concept is that of a schematic algebra . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Invariants for noncommutative spaces [ edit ] Some of the motivating questions of the theory are concerned with extending known topological invariants to formal duals of noncommutative (operator) algebras and other replacements and candidates for noncommutative spaces. One of the main starting points of Alain Connes \\' direction in noncommutative geometry is his discovery of a new homology theory associated to noncommutative associative algebras and noncommutative operator algebras, namely the cyclic homology and its relations to the algebraic K-theory (primarily via Connes–Chern character map). The theory of characteristic classes of smooth manifolds has been extended to spectral triples, employing the tools of operator K-theory and cyclic cohomology . Several generalizations of now-classical index theorems allow for effective extraction of numerical invariants from spectral triples. The fundamental characteristic class in cyclic cohomology, the JLO cocycle , generalizes the classical Chern character . Examples of noncommutative spaces [ edit ] In the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics,  the symplectic phase space of classical mechanics is deformed into a non-commutative phase space generated by the position and momentum operators . The noncommutative torus , deformation of the function algebra of the ordinary torus, can be given the structure of a spectral triple. This class of examples has been studied intensively and still functions as a test case for more complicated situations. Snyder space [ 11 ] Noncommutative algebras arising from foliations . Examples related to dynamical systems arising from number theory , such as the Gauss shift on continued fractions, give rise to noncommutative algebras that appear to have interesting noncommutative geometries. Connection [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2023 ) In the sense of Connes [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2023 ) A Connes connection is a noncommutative generalization of a connection in differential geometry . It was introduced by Alain Connes , and was later generalized by Joachim Cuntz and Daniel Quillen . Definition [ edit ] Given a right A -module E , a Connes connection on E is a linear map ∇ : E → E ⊗ A Ω 1 A {\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla :E\\\\to E\\\\otimes _{A}\\\\Omega ^{1}A} that satisfies the Leibniz rule ∇ r ( s a ) = ∇ r ( s ) a + s ⊗ d a {\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla _{r}(sa)=\\\\nabla _{r}(s)a+s\\\\otimes da} .

For other uses, see Commutative (disambiguation) . Commutative property Type Property Field Algebra Statement A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. Symbolic statement x ∗ y = y ∗ x ∀ x , y ∈ S . {\\\\displaystyle x*y=y*x\\\\quad \\\\forall x,y\\\\in S.} In mathematics , a binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. Perhaps most familiar as a property of arithmetic, e.g. \"3 + 4 = 4 + 3\" or \"2 × 5 = 5 × 2\" , the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as division and subtraction , that do not have it (for example, \"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3\" ); such operations are not commutative, and so are referred to as noncommutative operations . The idea that simple operations, such as the multiplication and addition of numbers, are commutative was for many centuries implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when new algebraic structures started to be studied. [ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] A binary operation ∗ {\\\\displaystyle *} on a set S is commutative if x ∗ y = y ∗ x {\\\\displaystyle x*y=y*x} for all x , y ∈ S {\\\\displaystyle x,y\\\\in S} . [ 2 ] An operation that is not commutative is said to be noncommutative . [ 3 ] One says that x commutes with y or that x and y commute under ∗ {\\\\displaystyle *} if [ 4 ] x ∗ y = y ∗ x . {\\\\displaystyle x*y=y*x.} So, an operation is commutative if every two elements commute. [ 4 ] An operation is noncommutative if there are two elements such that x ∗ y ≠ y ∗ x . {\\\\displaystyle x*y\\\\neq y*x.} This does not exclude the possibility that some pairs of elements commute. [ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative. Commutative operations [ edit ] The addition of vectors is commutative, because a → + b → = b → + a → . {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\vec {a}}+{\\\\vec {b}}={\\\\vec {b}}+{\\\\vec {a}}.} Addition and multiplication are commutative in most number systems , and, in particular, between natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , real numbers and complex numbers . This is also true in every field . [ 5 ] Addition is commutative in every vector space and in every algebra . [ 6 ] Union and intersection are commutative operations on sets . [ 7 ] \" And \" and \" or \" are commutative logical operations . [ 8 ] Noncommutative operations [ edit ] Division is noncommutative, since 1 ÷ 2 ≠ 2 ÷ 1 {\\\\displaystyle 1\\\\div 2\\\\neq 2\\\\div 1} . Subtraction is noncommutative, since 0 − 1 ≠ 1 − 0 {\\\\displaystyle 0-1\\\\neq 1-0} . However it is classified more precisely as anti-commutative , since x − y = − ( y − x ) {\\\\displaystyle x-y=-(y-x)} for every \\u2060 x {\\\\displaystyle x} \\u2060 and \\u2060 y {\\\\displaystyle y} \\u2060 . Exponentiation is noncommutative, since 2 3 ≠ 3 2 {\\\\displaystyle 2^{3}\\\\neq 3^{2}} (see Equation x y = y x . [ 9 ] Some truth functions are noncommutative, since their truth tables are different when one changes the order of the operands. [ 10 ] For example, the truth tables for (A ⇒ B) = (¬A ∨ B) and (B ⇒ A) = (A ∨ ¬B) are A B A ⇒ B B ⇒ A F F T T F T T F T F F T T T T T Function composition is generally noncommutative. [ 11 ] For example, if f ( x ) = 2 x + 1 {\\\\displaystyle f(x)=2x+1} and g ( x ) = 3 x + 7 {\\\\displaystyle g(x)=3x+7} . Then ( f ∘ g ) ( x ) = f ( g ( x ) ) = 2 ( 3 x + 7 ) + 1 = 6 x + 15 {\\\\displaystyle (f\\\\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))=2(3x+7)+1=6x+15} and ( g ∘ f ) ( x ) = g ( f ( x ) ) = 3 ( 2 x + 1 ) + 7 = 6 x + 10. {\\\\displaystyle (g\\\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=3(2x+1)+7=6x+10.} Matrix multiplication of square matrices of a given dimension is a noncommutative operation, except for \\u2060 1 × 1 {\\\\displaystyle 1\\\\times 1} \\u2060 matrices. For example: [ 12 ] [ 0 2 0 1 ] = [ 1 1 0 1 ] [ 0 1 0 1 ] ≠ [ 0 1 0 1 ] [ 1 1 0 1 ] = [ 0 1 0 1 ] {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{bmatrix}0&2\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{bmatrix}}={\\\\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{bmatrix}}{\\\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{bmatrix}}\\\\neq {\\\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{bmatrix}}{\\\\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{bmatrix}}={\\\\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\\\\\0&1\\\\end{bmatrix}}} The vector product (or cross product ) of two vectors in three dimensions is anti-commutative ; i.e., b × a = − ( a × b ) {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {b} \\\\times \\\\mathbf {a} =-(\\\\mathbf {a} \\\\times \\\\mathbf {b} )} . [ 13 ] Commutative structures [ edit ] Some types of algebraic structures involve an operation that does not require commutativity. If this operation is commutative for a specific structure, the structure is often said to be commutative . So, a commutative semigroup is a semigroup whose operation is commutative; [ 14 ] a commutative monoid is a monoid whose operation is commutative; [ 15 ] a commutative group or abelian group is a group whose operation is commutative; [ 16 ] a commutative ring is a ring whose multiplication is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.) [ 17 ] However, in the case of algebras , the phrase \" commutative algebra \" refers only to associative algebras that have a commutative multiplication. [ 18 ] History and etymology [ edit ] Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times. The Egyptians used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products . [ 19 ] Euclid is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book Elements . [ 20 ] Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions. Nowadays, the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics. [ 2 ] The first known use of the term was in a French Journal published in 1814 The first recorded use of the term commutative was in a memoir by François Servois in 1814, which used the word commutatives when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property. [ 21 ] Commutative is the feminine form of the French adjective commutatif , which is derived from the French noun commutation and the French verb commuter , meaning \"to exchange\" or \"to switch\", a cognate of to commute . The term then appeared in English in 1838. in Duncan Gregory \\'s article entitled \"On the real nature of symbolical algebra\" published in 1840 in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh .

Things 1.3: All Things Are Made of Atoms and Molecules 1.4: The Scientific Method: How Chemists Think Use the following paragraph to answer the first two questions. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died. Which of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming’s hypothesis? Nutrient broth kills bacteria. There are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn't grow. Mold kills bacteria. Penicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus. Without mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria. Fleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria. What step in the scientific method does this represent? Collecting and organizing data Making a hypothesis Testing a hypothesis by experiment Rejecting the old hypothesis and making a new one None of these A scientific investigation is NOT valid unless every step in the scientific method is present and carried out in the exact order listed in this chapter. True False Which of the following words is closest to the same meaning as hypothesis ? fact law formula suggestion conclusion Why do scientists sometimes discard theories? the steps in the scientific method were not followed in order public opinion disagrees with the theory the theory is opposed by the church contradictory observations are found congress voted against it Gary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day, that were the same size when planted, were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the same size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they had the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary’s hypothesis? Different plants have different characteristics. Plants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine. Plants that grow in the shade grow larger. Plants that don’t receive water will die. Plants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same? Gary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth. Gary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment. Gary want to control how much plant food his plants received. Gary wanted his garden to look organized. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday? Gary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants. Gary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth. Gary's hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth. Gary was conserving water. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day. What was the variable being tested in Gary's experiment? the amount of water the amount of plant food the amount of soil the amount of sunshine the type of soil Which of the following factors may be varying in Gary’s experimental setup that he did not control? individual plant variation soil temperature due to different colors of containers water loss due to evaporation from the soil the effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other All of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control. When a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host's skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment? to prove that the lice carried the typhus virus to prove the monkey was similar to man to prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus to prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus the workers were mean Eijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman’s hypothesis? Polyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens. White rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis. Unpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus. The rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis. None of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman's hypothesis. The three questions below relate to the following paragraphs. Scientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks. Scientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A's suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area. Which of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation? The only animals living in the area were giraffes. The only available food was on tall trees. Animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. A, B, and C are all interpretations. A, B, and C are all observations. Scientist A's hypothesis was that the only animals living in the area were giraffes. the only available food was on tall trees. animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. the animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species. None of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A's hypothesis. Scientist A's hypothesis being discarded is evidence that the scientific method doesn’t always work. a result achieved without use of the scientific method. an example of what happened before the scientific method was invented. an example of the normal functioning of the scientific method. an unusual case. When a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law. True False During Pasteur's time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livelihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have invented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier's claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier's hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier's cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier's cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D? So that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from. To make sure the injection actually contained anthrax. To serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows). To kill as many cows as possible. A hypothesis is a description of a consistent pattern in observations. an observation that remains constant. a theory that has been proven. a tentative explanation for a phenomenon. A number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence? Everyone who ate oysters got sick. People got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked. Symptoms included nausea and dizziness. The cook felt really bad about it. Bacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness. Which statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls? Experimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes. Experimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests. Experimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed. Experimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable. A student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The five seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment? The student has too few pots. The student has two independent variables. The student has two dependent variables. The student has no experimental control on the soil. A scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment? Corn without fertilizer. Corn with fertilizer. Amount of water. Height of corn plants. If you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true? There can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences, or else the experiment is invalid. The control group and the test group may have many differences between them. The control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable. None of these are true. If the hypothesis is rejected by the experiment, then: the experiment may have been a success. the experiment was a failure. the experiment was poorly designed. the experiment didn't follow the scientific method. A well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world is a: theory. law. hypothesis. None of these. 1.5: A Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed 1.E: Exercises is shared under a CK-12 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.

produce or deliver adequate colostrum to foal) Foal factors (failure to suckle or absorb adequate colostrum) Knowledge check SNAP® Foal IgG Test Procedure Knowledge check Interpretation of Foal IgG Quick and dirty interpretation Knowledge check Equine failure of passive transfer testing In your large animal medicine courses, you will learn about the failure of passive (FPT) transfer in more clinical detail than what will be covered in this course. Depending on the placental structure, gravid animals may or may not have the ability to transfer antibodies to their offspring in utero. For animals such as horses and cows, antibodies are not transferred to their offspring in utero during pregnancy making the ingestion of colostrum, which is rich in maternal immunoglobulins, immediately after birth essential to survival. This transfer of humoral immunity from the dam to the offspring is called passive transfer. Failure of passive transfer (FPT; agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia) occurs when the neonatal foal fails to ingest and/or absorb an adequate amount of immunoglobulin from colostrum There are both foal and dam factors that may result in FPT. A few of those include: Dam factors (failure to produce or deliver adequate colostrum to foal) Inadequate amount of immunoglobulins transferred into colostrum Loss of colostrum prior to parturition ( g. premature lactation) Behavioral factors (unwillingness to accept foal or allow it to nurse) Dam death (orphan foal) Foal factors (failure to suckle or absorb adequate colostrum) Congenital abnormalities that prevent the foal from standing or nursing Illnesses or injuries that prevent the foal from standing or nursing Inability to absorb immunoglobulins from the gut To answer the questions in your laboratory activity. Please refer to the IDEXX website . Knowledge check Query \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\) SNAP® Foal IgG Test There are several in-clinic diagnostic tests that can be used to screen for FPT in foals (and other species). These tests uses serum or whole blood is taken from the foal to detect IgG levels. Unlike the other SNAP tests that you will run in this laboratory, the SNAP Foal IgG test is semi-quantitative, as the intensity of color change compared to the calibration spot is used to semi-quantify IgG levels in the foal’s blood. Procedure Remove the cap and dropper tip from the sample diluent bottle. Gently mix whole-blood samples by inverting in the EDTA tube Using the plastic sample loops provided, carefully immerse ONLY the loop tip into the blood or serum sample. Visually confirm that the loop is filled. *For whole-blood samples, we recommend immersing the loop tip in the sample that remains in the cap of the sample collection container. Immerse the loop tip only. Do not immerse the loop handle in the sample. *For serum and plasma, use one loop. For whole blood, use two separate loops. Transfer the filled loop by immersing and twirling the loop tip in the bottle of sample diluent. Firmly seat the dropper tip on the sample diluent bottle. Mix thoroughly by inverting five times. Hold the sample diluent bottle vertically and dispose of the first 5–10 drops from the bottle. Place the SNAP device on a flat surface. With the bottle tip ½ to 1 inch directly above the SNAP device, carefully apply one drop of the diluted sample directly onto the sample spot in the result window . Visually confirm that the drop of the diluted sample has wetted the sample spot completely. If the drop of the diluted sample has not wetted the sample spot completely, repeat the sample application using a new SNAP device. Remove the cap from the conjugate bottle and pour its contents into the sample well of the SNAP device. (Some of the contents will remain in the conjugate bottle.) The sample will flow across the result window, reaching the activation circle in 30 to 90 seconds. (Some conjugate will remain in the sample well at activation.) Watch the device carefully for color in the activation circle. When color FIRST appears in the activation circle, push the activator firmly until it is flush with the device’s body. Keep the device horizontal to ensure accurate results. Wait 7 minutes . Visually read the test result. SNAP Foal IgG Procedure Knowledge check Query \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\) Interpretation of Foal IgG The window of your SNAP test should have three BLUE dots following testing. These dots include the 400 mg/dL spot 800 mg/ dL spot, and our patient sample spot. SNAP test window with calibrator spots and sample spot Depending on the intensity of your patient spot in comparison to the calibration spots is used to determine the blood levels of IgG in the foal. The sensitivity of this test is high but the specificity for FPT is lower meaning this test is only used on animals with a high index of clinical suspicion for FPT . For example, if the patient sample spot is lighter blue than the 400 mg/dL and 800 mg/dL spots, then the foal is estimated to have <400 mg/dL of IgG in his/her bloodstream. This would be interpreted as the following: Since the sensitivity of this test is high, but the specificity is low, in a patient with a high clinical index of suspicious for FPT, following additional testing (CBC/ Chem), this patient is considered to likely be suffering from FPT. On the reverse end of the testing, if the patient color spot is stronger blue than the 800 mg/dL spot, then the clinical signs observed in your patient are unlikely to be the result of FPT. Quick and dirty interpretation IgG > 800 mg/dL → adequate passive transfer (good/normal immune protection) IgG between 400 – 800 mg/dL → partial failure of passive transfer (partial protection) IgG < 400 mg/dL → complete failure of passive transfer (very susceptible to infection) Interpreting the Foal IgG test Knowledge check Query \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\) Key Takeaways Rapid point of care tests commonly used ELISA techniques These tests can be used to detect a wide variety of things including antibodies, antigens, proteins, chemicals, etc. Most rapid point of care tests are used as screening tools You have now reached the end of Module 11.

mechanisms used for parasite control in common domestic species Define refugia Describe pasture management for parasite control Parasite Infection and Tools for Diagnosis Parasites, either internal (for example, worms) or external (for example, fleas and ticks), draw nutrients away from the host, and can cause disease. This chapter will focus on demonstration of how your understanding of the life cycle of parasites for various species in different environments will help minimize infection or infestation and help with control of the parasite in the environment. The biggest difference appears to be in overall management between large animals and small animals. In large animals, there is concern about resistance of parasites to available deworming medications and great attention is paid to minimizing development of resistant parasites. This may include leaving a small population of worms untreated, so there always are susceptible worms in the overall population and we are not just continually killing off susceptible worms and leaving behind more and more resistant worms. In small animals, where parasites can be a significant public health concern, it is a goal to kill all internal and external parasites. This does not mean there are no concerns about resistance; in 2021, resistance in hookworms, one intestinal parasite of dogs, was described. Gastrointestinal parasites are the class most commonly addressed. Some common tools used to evaluate presence of gastrointestinal parasites are fecal flotation tests and fecal egg counts. Fecal egg counts are basically quantified fecal flotations. You will also hear fecal flotations called fecal floats. Dr. Erin Burton provides the following differentiation between these two kinds of tests and how they’re interpreted: A fecal flotation is a qualitative assessment of the eggs in a sample, while a fecal egg count (FEC) is a quantitative assessment. Fecal flotations are lax on the amount of solution and feces used for each float and so give at best a semi-quantitative assessment of egg burden. FECs use a measured amount of feces and solution, and then plug the number into a formula to get the egg count. FEC usually is done more than once; in order to interpret them they are performed over time and because of that they are the test primarily used to definitively define the degree of drug resistance in an animal or herd. It is also important when evaluating a fecal float or FEC to be aware of how prolific of an egg layer the nematode is. For example, one Toxocara canis (roundworm) can produce over 20,000 eggs each day while a whipworm only produces about 1000 per day. Thus, having larger numbers of whipworm eggs on a float or FEC is more indicative of a heavy worm burden than abundant Toxocara eggs on float or FEC. Finally, be aware that not all gastrointestinal parasites can be identified by fecal flotation testing. For example, tapeworm eggs generally are released within tapeworm segments, or proglottids, and because the individual eggs are not in the feces and the proglottids are too heavy to float, tapeworm infections generally cannot be diagnosed by fecal flotation testing. Beef Cattle Parasites can have potential negative effects on beef cattle that can vary from subclinical immune suppression, irritation, annoyance, appetite suppression, and decreased production, to severe clinical disease and death. The management of parasites is a component of a preventive health program that should also include immunity management (vaccinations), management procedures, handling, and nutritional considerations that reflect an in-depth understanding of not only the beef production system but farm-specific issues and goals. Internal Parasites Internal parasites include roundworms (nematodes), tapeworms (cestodes), flukes (trematodes) and protozoans (such as coccidia). Roundworms are considered the most economically important, and many programs revolve around their management. This section regarding internal parasites in beef cattle will focus around roundworms. Understanding the parasite life cycle and the level of parasite pressure is key to the management of internal parasites. The following is the basic life cycle of internal (gastrointestinal) parasites in cattle: Adult parasites live in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle and lay eggs that are shed in the manure. When a parasite egg is shed on the pasture in the feces, this egg begins development, embryonating into a first stage larva (L1), then molting into a second stage larva (L2), and finally molting again into a third and infective stage larva (L3). During the first two larval stages in the fecal pat, the larva are fairly immobile, feeding off the bacteria and other debris found in the feces. During the third larval stage the larva move out of the fecal pat and onto nearby grass where they are consumed by cattle. L3 larvae maintain an external sheath covering that provides extra protection from environmental conditions allowing survival during winter or drought conditions. This sheath prevents feeding, thus L3 larvae have a limited life span. Egg development is greatly dependent upon temperature and moisture. Eggs that are passed in the middle of winter will not develop until warm weather returns in the spring. Eggs passed in the middle of a drought or other unfavorable conditions may develop into infective larvae in the feces but without moisture cannot move away from the pat where they can be consumed by a host animal when it eats grass. Eggs that are shed during favorable conditions can develop into infective larvae in just a few days if temperatures are warm and moisture is plentiful. Once consumed by cattle, the infective larvae mature into adults over a period of 3-4 weeks (shorter in younger cattle, longer in adult cattle) and begin to lay eggs, which are shed onto pastures to start the cycle over again. Some larvae can become inhibited or hypobiotic (go into hibernation) in the wall of the abomasum, sometimes referred to as L4 larvae. This process can occur during the winter in the north and in the summer in the south, with these larvae maturing and developing into adult worms when the environment for egg survival is more favorable. Overall, the controlling of internal parasites has a significant positive return on investment for producers. The main focus of internal parasite control in beef cattle is roundworms. Diagnostics are needed to determine which specific worms are present. For beef cattle this is important because the roundworm life cycle depends on the shedding of the eggs on pasture, larvae development, and the ingestion of the larvae during grazing. Since much of beef cattle production depends on grazing of pastures, the management of roundworms is key. As long as cattle have access to grass, they will have an internal parasite challenge. Control practices should consider the class (or age) of cattle, nutrition status, stress level, season, and likelihood of parasite contamination of the environment, and involve the use of pasture management options as well as the use of anthelmintic (dewormer) products for treatment. Life-Cycle of Internal Parasites “Lifecycle of a typical roundworm”, https://www.progressivecattle.com/topics/management/parasite-control-in-stocker-and-grower-cattle Infective L3 larvae in a drop of dew enter the cow’s mouth when eating grass. Ingested larvae penetrate the stomach and pass in the lymph to the lungs. Adults live in lungs and lay eggs. Eggs are coughed into mouth from lungs and swallowed. Eggs hatch to larvae as they pass through intestines. L1 larvae on fungus grow in dung pat. L2 larvae live in dung pat. L3 larvae move onto grass where they again can be ingested by cows. Parasite Contamination Susceptibility PRIORITIZED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PARASITES ENVIRONMENTAL PARASITE CONTAMINATION LIKELIHOOD Calves > Yearlings > Adult bulls > Adult cows Spring / Early summer > Late summer (dry season) > Winter Nutritionally challenged > Not nutritionally challenged Continuously grazed pasture > Rested pasture > Not grazed / Hayed pasture > Recently tilled > Dry lot Stressed (newly weaned, heat/cold stress, etc) > Not stressed Some pasture management activities may include leaving the pasture fallow, grazing other species, and dragging manure pats during the dry season to allow them to dry out. Anthelmintics used to control internal parasites for beef cattle come in several forms including paste, injectable, drench, pour-on, bolus, and as a feed or mineral additive. Products have varying lengths of activity and costs, but fall into two main classes: benzimidazoles and macrocylic lactones. Benzimidazoles (white dewormers) available commercially contain albendazole, fenbendazole, or oxfendazole. Benzimidazoles are effective against most of the major adult gastrointestinal parasites and many of the larval stages. Products come in various oral formulations and have a short duration of efficacy. Macrocyclic lactones are the avermectins and milbemycins. Products in commercial use contain ivermectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, or moxidectin. The macrocyclic lactones have a potent, broad antiparasitic spectrum at low dose levels. They are active against many larval stages (including hypobiotic larvae) and are active against many external parasites as well. Products are available as oral, subcutaneous, and pour-on formulations for use in cattle. Duration of efficacy varies with the product and may be up to 35 days. Approaches used to treat parasites in beef cattle are considered strategic deworming. This is the practice of treating cattle at times to not only get the benefit in that animal to prevent economic loss but also reduce environmental contamination for a period of time at least equal to the life cycle of the parasite removed. Keys to strategic deworming are to place cattle that are not shedding eggs on pastures that are not infected; this is accomplished by deworming prior to spring turnout or fall treatment in the north (following killing frost). The benefit of treating in the fall is that cattle should be free of internal parasites all winter and going into the spring turnout (assuming an effective product was used). Cattle that go onto pasture at spring turnout are free of parasites, thus not shedding eggs, and will be consuming the infective larvae on the pasture if the pasture is contaminated. By consuming the infective larvae and not shedding new ones the cows will be reducing the load on the pasture (acting as vacuum cleaners). After a time the ingested infective larvae will mature and cows will start shedding eggs. Strategic deworming times the treatment so as to reduce the worm burden on the cattle and also decrease the parasite contamination of the pasture during the highest parasite period (spring/early summer). The timing of these treatments can and should be timed with other management procedures such as summer vaccines for the calves and fall processing of calves and cows. Depending on the geographic location, such as in the south where the weather (moisture) is different, timings may be different, as well as the type of grazing program. Calves and stockers should be considered within a strategic program while on a grazing program. Times of concern include prior to weaning while nursing the cow and while intensively grazing as a stocker. Calves should not be dewormed while being weaned. Preweaning treatment, prior to the stress of weaning, can reduce the potential negative impact on immune function as well as improve performance. Any time cattle are moving from pasture into a dry lot setting is a good time to deworm as this should clear cattle of parasite load for the time in the dry lot (similar to fall deworming) as there is no green grass to graze. For the control of other types of internal parasites such as tapeworms (cestodes), flukes (trematodes), and protozoans (such as coccidia), similar concepts are applied. It is important to understand the different life cycles of these different types of parasites as well as the efficacy of products used to treat them. External Parasites The major external parasites that affect cattle include flies, grubs, lice, ticks, and mites. These external parasites feed on body tissues such as blood and skin, and in addition they cause irritation and discomfort that result in reduced weight gain and lost production. Parasites that take blood meals have the potential to serve as vectors for the transmission of diseases. Horn Flies Horn flies are blood-sucking flies that stay on the shoulders and backs of cattle almost continuously. A horn fly leaves the back of a cow or calf only to lay eggs in fresh manure. They take blood meals from the host 24 hours a day. Face Flies Face flies cluster on the faces of cattle and feed on secretions from the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and lips. Face flies do not suck blood. They do irritate the surface of the eyeball and may carry pathogens that contribute to pinkeye problems. They spend only a small portion of their life on cattle. Stable Flies Stable flies feed primarily on the legs and lower abdomen of cattle and take blood meals two to three times a day depending on the weather. After feeding they move to a resting place to digest the blood meal. Stable flies are associated with substantial economic loss in cattle from the blood loss and pain from feeding. As few as five flies per leg is economically significant in cattle. Ticks Ticks cause blood loss and discomfort, and can act as vectors for disease spread. High concentrations of ticks usually occur in brushy pastures and woodlands. Lice Lice that affect cattle are either of the biting or sucking type, and cause skin irritation and itching. The entire life cycle of lice is on the host and they are present year round but populations increase in winter months. Lice spread through contact with infested cattle. Infested cattle can experience reduced appetite and anemia, and appear unthrifty. Mites In cattle, mites can cause hair loss and a thickening of the skin. Infestation by mites is called mange. Mites are spread by close contact. Severe mange can weaken cattle and make them vulnerable to diseases. Certain types of mites are reportable. Cattle Grubs (warbles) Cattle grubs, or warbles, are the larval stage of the heel fly. The larvae migrate from the animal’s heel, where the eggs are deposited by the adult fly in early summer, to the back of the animal. The larvae can cause damage to the hide (due to the breathing hole they create) and if treated during the wrong time of the year can cause paralysis due to their location near the spinal column. Cattle should not be treated with a grubicide between November 15 and March 1 if cattle grubs are a concern . Control of External Parasites Control of external parasites usually revolves around the use of insecticides. These usually are a pyrethrin or an organophosphate. Strategies or combinations of strategies for delivery include: dust bags, back-rubbers (oilers), animal sprays, pour-ons, and insecticide impregnated ear tags. In addition, the use of injectable products or pour-ons with systemic activity work well to control lice and mites. Larvicides can also be part of control plan for certain types of flies as well as the use of predator wasps and environmental management. The use of dust bags and back-rubbers (oilers) can provide delivery of insecticides and economic fly control if located in an area that cattle are forced to move through such as a gateway or over a mineral feeder. Delivery of Insecticides “Insecticide cattle care”, http://easywaycattlecare.com/images/walkway-3.jpg Insecticide sprays and pour-ons are effective for many different external parasites but have the drawback of increased animal handling costs and stress during the fly-season. Insecticide sprays are the only way to manage adult stable flies. Ear tags impregnated with insecticide can be effective in fly control. Maximizing control requires two tags per animal, and timing of application with peak fly numbers often requires a separate handling session of the animals. Ear tags provide good face fly control if applied properly. Insecticide Ear Tag Fly Control “Corathon insecticide cattle ear tags”, https://www.pbsanimalhealth.com/products/corathon-insecticde-cattle-ear-tags Larvicides prevent fly larvae from developing in to adults and are administered through free choice mineral. To be effective cattle must consume an adequate amount and not be in the proximity of untreated cattle. Injectable products and pour-ons with systemic activity are mainly the macrocyclic lactones. These are effective against some flies as well as mites and lice. For mites and lice a second treatment may be needed in two to three weeks to kill newly hatched parasites unless using an extended duration product. Sanitation or cleaning up of wasted feed or manure that serve as egg-laying sites for certain flies can greatly contribute to the control of certain flies locally. In addition, egg laying sites may be treated with a larvicide. Environmental management may be a key component to tick control. The reduction of brushy areas and thick wooded areas reduces the habitat for the ticks and reduces exposure. Certain native parasitic wasps are used as biological control agents of fly populations. Currently, farmers can buy parasitic wasps from commercial insectaries. These wasps emerge into adulthood from the pupal stage, where they develop wings. They fly from the release stations in which they have been held, hung from barn ceilings or other out-of-reach places. The wasps only target flies in their pupal stage. When the wasp finds a pupa in soil or litter, she inserts her stinger and withdraws it, drawing blood and paralyzing the pupa and inserting one egg. The egg hatches after 1 day, and the larva feeds on body fluids and organs for 2-4 weeks. Eventually, the wasp chews its way out of the dead host’s puparium and flies away as an adult. Example Strategic Control Program “Strategic Control: Beef Monograph”, http://www.midamericaagresearch.net/documents/BeefMonograph.pdf Stocker, yearling and replacement heifers dewormed at turnout, four and eight weeks after onset of grazing (0-4-8). Cow/calf deworming six weeks after onset of grazing. If cattle were not dewormed in the fall, adult cows should be dewormed at pasture turnout and again six weeks after onset of grazing. All cattle retained over winter should be dewormed. During lice season, two treatments two to three weeks apart may be necessary. Grub treatment three to four months after the end of heel fly season, varies south to north. Requires systemic, annual control only. Cattle grazed along the Gulf Coast and Northwest coast should be treated for adult and immature liver flukes. (Horn-fly control as needed to keep populations below 200 flies per animal.) There is increasing evidence of antiparasitic resistance in grazing species, such as cattle, small ruminants (sheep and goats), and horses, both globally and within the United States. Antiparasitic resistance is the genetic ability of parasites to survive treatment with an antiparasitic drug that was generally effective against those parasites in the past. Many factors contribute to antiparasitic resistance, including the biology of the parasite; the immune status of the host animal; treatment practices; drug properties; and certain livestock management practices. To help combat this emerging problem, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine started the Antiparasitic Resistance Management Strategy (ARMS) . Dairy Cattle As in beef cattle, the overarching theme for the prevention strategy of parasitic infection is to reduce the animals’ exposure to parasites and their infectious forms. Because multiple animals will be exposed, any strategy will focus on entire groups of animals rather than individuals. So far, this is similar to prevention strategies for any other infectious diseases on farm. However, when thinking about the pre... [Content truncated]\n",

Things 1.3: All Things Are Made of Atoms and Molecules 1.4: The Scientific Method: How Chemists Think Use the following paragraph to answer the first two questions. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died. Which of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming’s hypothesis? Nutrient broth kills bacteria. There are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn't grow. Mold kills bacteria. Penicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus. Without mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria. Fleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria. What step in the scientific method does this represent? Collecting and organizing data Making a hypothesis Testing a hypothesis by experiment Rejecting the old hypothesis and making a new one None of these A scientific investigation is NOT valid unless every step in the scientific method is present and carried out in the exact order listed in this chapter. True False Which of the following words is closest to the same meaning as hypothesis ? fact law formula suggestion conclusion Why do scientists sometimes discard theories? the steps in the scientific method were not followed in order public opinion disagrees with the theory the theory is opposed by the church contradictory observations are found congress voted against it Gary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day, that were the same size when planted, were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the same size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they had the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary’s hypothesis? Different plants have different characteristics. Plants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine. Plants that grow in the shade grow larger. Plants that don’t receive water will die. Plants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same? Gary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth. Gary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment. Gary want to control how much plant food his plants received. Gary wanted his garden to look organized. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday? Gary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants. Gary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth. Gary's hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth. Gary was conserving water. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day. What was the variable being tested in Gary's experiment? the amount of water the amount of plant food the amount of soil the amount of sunshine the type of soil Which of the following factors may be varying in Gary’s experimental setup that he did not control? individual plant variation soil temperature due to different colors of containers water loss due to evaporation from the soil the effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other All of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control. When a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host's skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment? to prove that the lice carried the typhus virus to prove the monkey was similar to man to prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus to prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus the workers were mean Eijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman’s hypothesis? Polyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens. White rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis. Unpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus. The rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis. None of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman's hypothesis. The three questions below relate to the following paragraphs. Scientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks. Scientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A's suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area. Which of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation? The only animals living in the area were giraffes. The only available food was on tall trees. Animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. A, B, and C are all interpretations. A, B, and C are all observations. Scientist A's hypothesis was that the only animals living in the area were giraffes. the only available food was on tall trees. animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. the animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species. None of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A's hypothesis. Scientist A's hypothesis being discarded is evidence that the scientific method doesn’t always work. a result achieved without use of the scientific method. an example of what happened before the scientific method was invented. an example of the normal functioning of the scientific method. an unusual case. When a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law. True False During Pasteur's time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livelihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have invented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier's claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier's hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier's cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier's cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D? So that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from. To make sure the injection actually contained anthrax. To serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows). To kill as many cows as possible. A hypothesis is a description of a consistent pattern in observations. an observation that remains constant. a theory that has been proven. a tentative explanation for a phenomenon. A number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence? Everyone who ate oysters got sick. People got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked. Symptoms included nausea and dizziness. The cook felt really bad about it. Bacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness. Which statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls? Experimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes. Experimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests. Experimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed. Experimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable. A student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The five seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment? The student has too few pots. The student has two independent variables. The student has two dependent variables. The student has no experimental control on the soil. A scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment? Corn without fertilizer. Corn with fertilizer. Amount of water. Height of corn plants. If you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true? There can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences, or else the experiment is invalid. The control group and the test group may have many differences between them. The control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable. None of these are true. If the hypothesis is rejected by the experiment, then: the experiment may have been a success. the experiment was a failure. the experiment was poorly designed. the experiment didn't follow the scientific method. A well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world is a: theory. law. hypothesis. None of these. 1.5: A Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed 1.E: Exercises is shared under a CK-12 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.

The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n",

Molecules 1.4: The Scientific Method: How Chemists Think Use the following paragraph to answer the first two questions. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died. Which of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming’s hypothesis? Nutrient broth kills bacteria. There are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn\\'t grow. Mold kills bacteria. Penicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus. Without mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria. Fleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria. What step in the scientific method does this represent? Collecting and organizing data Making a hypothesis Testing a hypothesis by experiment Rejecting the old hypothesis and making a new one None of these A scientific investigation is NOT valid unless every step in the scientific method is present and carried out in the exact order listed in this chapter. True False Which of the following words is closest to the same meaning as hypothesis ? fact law formula suggestion conclusion Why do scientists sometimes discard theories? the steps in the scientific method were not followed in order public opinion disagrees with the theory the theory is opposed by the church contradictory observations are found congress voted against it Gary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day, that were the same size when planted, were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the same size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they had the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary’s hypothesis? Different plants have different characteristics. Plants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine. Plants that grow in the shade grow larger. Plants that don’t receive water will die. Plants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same? Gary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth. Gary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment. Gary want to control how much plant food his plants received. Gary wanted his garden to look organized. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday? Gary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants. Gary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth. Gary\\'s hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth. Gary was conserving water. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day. What was the variable being tested in Gary\\'s experiment? the amount of water the amount of plant food the amount of soil the amount of sunshine the type of soil Which of the following factors may be varying in Gary’s experimental setup that he did not control? individual plant variation soil temperature due to different colors of containers water loss due to evaporation from the soil the effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other All of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control. When a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host\\'s skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment? to prove that the lice carried the typhus virus to prove the monkey was similar to man to prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus to prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus the workers were mean Eijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman’s hypothesis? Polyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens. White rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis. Unpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus. The rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis. None of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman\\'s hypothesis. The three questions below relate to the following paragraphs. Scientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks. Scientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A\\'s suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area. Which of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation? The only animals living in the area were giraffes. The only available food was on tall trees. Animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. A, B, and C are all interpretations. A, B, and C are all observations. Scientist A\\'s hypothesis was that the only animals living in the area were giraffes. the only available food was on tall trees. animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. the animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species. None of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A\\'s hypothesis. Scientist A\\'s hypothesis being discarded is evidence that the scientific method doesn’t always work. a result achieved without use of the scientific method. an example of what happened before the scientific method was invented. an example of the normal functioning of the scientific method. an unusual case. When a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law. True False During Pasteur\\'s time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livelihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have invented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier\\'s claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier\\'s hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier\\'s cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier\\'s cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D? So that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from. To make sure the injection actually contained anthrax. To serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows). To kill as many cows as possible. A hypothesis is a description of a consistent pattern in observations. an observation that remains constant. a theory that has been proven. a tentative explanation for a phenomenon. A number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence? Everyone who ate oysters got sick. People got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked. Symptoms included nausea and dizziness. The cook felt really bad about it. Bacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness. Which statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls? Experimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes. Experimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests. Experimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed. Experimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable. A student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The five seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment? The student has too few pots. The student has two independent variables. The student has two dependent variables. The student has no experimental control on the soil. A scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment? Corn without fertilizer. Corn with fertilizer. Amount of water. Height of corn plants. If you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true? There can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences, or else the experiment is invalid. The control group and the test group may have many differences between them. The control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable. None of these are true. If the hypothesis is rejected by the experiment, then: the experiment may have been a success. the experiment was a failure. the experiment was poorly designed. the experiment didn\\'t follow the scientific method. A well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world is a: theory. law. hypothesis. None of these. 1.5: A Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed 1.E: Exercises is shared under a CK-12 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.

foal) Foal factors (failure to suckle or absorb adequate colostrum) Knowledge check SNAP® Foal IgG Test Procedure Knowledge check Interpretation of Foal IgG Quick and dirty interpretation Knowledge check Equine failure of passive transfer testing In your large animal medicine courses, you will learn about the failure of passive (FPT) transfer in more clinical detail than what will be covered in this course. Depending on the placental structure, gravid animals may or may not have the ability to transfer antibodies to their offspring in utero. For animals such as horses and cows, antibodies are not transferred to their offspring in utero during pregnancy making the ingestion of colostrum, which is rich in maternal immunoglobulins, immediately after birth essential to survival. This transfer of humoral immunity from the dam to the offspring is called passive transfer. Failure of passive transfer (FPT; agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia) occurs when the neonatal foal fails to ingest and/or absorb an adequate amount of immunoglobulin from colostrum There are both foal and dam factors that may result in FPT. A few of those include: Dam factors (failure to produce or deliver adequate colostrum to foal) Inadequate amount of immunoglobulins transferred into colostrum Loss of colostrum prior to parturition ( g. premature lactation) Behavioral factors (unwillingness to accept foal or allow it to nurse) Dam death (orphan foal) Foal factors (failure to suckle or absorb adequate colostrum) Congenital abnormalities that prevent the foal from standing or nursing Illnesses or injuries that prevent the foal from standing or nursing Inability to absorb immunoglobulins from the gut To answer the questions in your laboratory activity. Please refer to the IDEXX website . Knowledge check Query \\\\(\\\\PageIndex{1}\\\\) SNAP® Foal IgG Test There are several in-clinic diagnostic tests that can be used to screen for FPT in foals (and other species). These tests uses serum or whole blood is taken from the foal to detect IgG levels. Unlike the other SNAP tests that you will run in this laboratory, the SNAP Foal IgG test is semi-quantitative, as the intensity of color change compared to the calibration spot is used to semi-quantify IgG levels in the foal’s blood. Procedure Remove the cap and dropper tip from the sample diluent bottle. Gently mix whole-blood samples by inverting in the EDTA tube Using the plastic sample loops provided, carefully immerse ONLY the loop tip into the blood or serum sample. Visually confirm that the loop is filled. *For whole-blood samples, we recommend immersing the loop tip in the sample that remains in the cap of the sample collection container. Immerse the loop tip only. Do not immerse the loop handle in the sample. *For serum and plasma, use one loop. For whole blood, use two separate loops. Transfer the filled loop by immersing and twirling the loop tip in the bottle of sample diluent. Firmly seat the dropper tip on the sample diluent bottle. Mix thoroughly by inverting five times. Hold the sample diluent bottle vertically and dispose of the first 5–10 drops from the bottle. Place the SNAP device on a flat surface. With the bottle tip ½ to 1 inch directly above the SNAP device, carefully apply one drop of the diluted sample directly onto the sample spot in the result window . Visually confirm that the drop of the diluted sample has wetted the sample spot completely. If the drop of the diluted sample has not wetted the sample spot completely, repeat the sample application using a new SNAP device. Remove the cap from the conjugate bottle and pour its contents into the sample well of the SNAP device. (Some of the contents will remain in the conjugate bottle.) The sample will flow across the result window, reaching the activation circle in 30 to 90 seconds. (Some conjugate will remain in the sample well at activation.) Watch the device carefully for color in the activation circle. When color FIRST appears in the activation circle, push the activator firmly until it is flush with the device’s body. Keep the device horizontal to ensure accurate results. Wait 7 minutes . Visually read the test result. SNAP Foal IgG Procedure Knowledge check Query \\\\(\\\\PageIndex{2}\\\\) Interpretation of Foal IgG The window of your SNAP test should have three BLUE dots following testing. These dots include the 400 mg/dL spot 800 mg/ dL spot, and our patient sample spot. SNAP test window with calibrator spots and sample spot Depending on the intensity of your patient spot in comparison to the calibration spots is used to determine the blood levels of IgG in the foal. The sensitivity of this test is high but the specificity for FPT is lower meaning this test is only used on animals with a high index of clinical suspicion for FPT . For example, if the patient sample spot is lighter blue than the 400 mg/dL and 800 mg/dL spots, then the foal is estimated to have <400 mg/dL of IgG in his/her bloodstream. This would be interpreted as the following: Since the sensitivity of this test is high, but the specificity is low, in a patient with a high clinical index of suspicious for FPT, following additional testing (CBC/ Chem), this patient is considered to likely be suffering from FPT. On the reverse end of the testing, if the patient color spot is stronger blue than the 800 mg/dL spot, then the clinical signs observed in your patient are unlikely to be the result of FPT. Quick and dirty interpretation IgG > 800 mg/dL → adequate passive transfer (good/normal immune protection) IgG between 400 – 800 mg/dL → partial failure of passive transfer (partial protection) IgG < 400 mg/dL → complete failure of passive transfer (very susceptible to infection) Interpreting the Foal IgG test Knowledge check Query \\\\(\\\\PageIndex{3}\\\\) Key Takeaways Rapid point of care tests commonly used ELISA techniques These tests can be used to detect a wide variety of things including antibodies, antigens, proteins, chemicals, etc. Most rapid point of care tests are used as screening tools You have now reached the end of Module 11.

domestic species Define refugia Describe pasture management for parasite control Parasite Infection and Tools for Diagnosis Parasites, either internal (for example, worms) or external (for example, fleas and ticks), draw nutrients away from the host, and can cause disease. This chapter will focus on demonstration of how your understanding of the life cycle of parasites for various species in different environments will help minimize infection or infestation and help with control of the parasite in the environment. The biggest difference appears to be in overall management between large animals and small animals. In large animals, there is concern about resistance of parasites to available deworming medications and great attention is paid to minimizing development of resistant parasites. This may include leaving a small population of worms untreated, so there always are susceptible worms in the overall population and we are not just continually killing off susceptible worms and leaving behind more and more resistant worms. In small animals, where parasites can be a significant public health concern, it is a goal to kill all internal and external parasites. This does not mean there are no concerns about resistance; in 2021, resistance in hookworms, one intestinal parasite of dogs, was described. Gastrointestinal parasites are the class most commonly addressed. Some common tools used to evaluate presence of gastrointestinal parasites are fecal flotation tests and fecal egg counts. Fecal egg counts are basically quantified fecal flotations. You will also hear fecal flotations called fecal floats. Dr. Erin Burton provides the following differentiation between these two kinds of tests and how they’re interpreted: A fecal flotation is a qualitative assessment of the eggs in a sample, while a fecal egg count (FEC) is a quantitative assessment. Fecal flotations are lax on the amount of solution and feces used for each float and so give at best a semi-quantitative assessment of egg burden. FECs use a measured amount of feces and solution, and then plug the number into a formula to get the egg count. FEC usually is done more than once; in order to interpret them they are performed over time and because of that they are the test primarily used to definitively define the degree of drug resistance in an animal or herd. It is also important when evaluating a fecal float or FEC to be aware of how prolific of an egg layer the nematode is. For example, one Toxocara canis (roundworm) can produce over 20,000 eggs each day while a whipworm only produces about 1000 per day. Thus, having larger numbers of whipworm eggs on a float or FEC is more indicative of a heavy worm burden than abundant Toxocara eggs on float or FEC. Finally, be aware that not all gastrointestinal parasites can be identified by fecal flotation testing. For example, tapeworm eggs generally are released within tapeworm segments, or proglottids, and because the individual eggs are not in the feces and the proglottids are too heavy to float, tapeworm infections generally cannot be diagnosed by fecal flotation testing. Beef Cattle Parasites can have potential negative effects on beef cattle that can vary from subclinical immune suppression, irritation, annoyance, appetite suppression, and decreased production, to severe clinical disease and death. The management of parasites is a component of a preventive health program that should also include immunity management (vaccinations), management procedures, handling, and nutritional considerations that reflect an in-depth understanding of not only the beef production system but farm-specific issues and goals. Internal Parasites Internal parasites include roundworms (nematodes), tapeworms (cestodes), flukes (trematodes) and protozoans (such as coccidia). Roundworms are considered the most economically important, and many programs revolve around their management. This section regarding internal parasites in beef cattle will focus around roundworms. Understanding the parasite life cycle and the level of parasite pressure is key to the management of internal parasites. The following is the basic life cycle of internal (gastrointestinal) parasites in cattle: Adult parasites live in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle and lay eggs that are shed in the manure. When a parasite egg is shed on the pasture in the feces, this egg begins development, embryonating into a first stage larva (L1), then molting into a second stage larva (L2), and finally molting again into a third and infective stage larva (L3). During the first two larval stages in the fecal pat, the larva are fairly immobile, feeding off the bacteria and other debris found in the feces. During the third larval stage the larva move out of the fecal pat and onto nearby grass where they are consumed by cattle. L3 larvae maintain an external sheath covering that provides extra protection from environmental conditions allowing survival during winter or drought conditions. This sheath prevents feeding, thus L3 larvae have a limited life span. Egg development is greatly dependent upon temperature and moisture. Eggs that are passed in the middle of winter will not develop until warm weather returns in the spring. Eggs passed in the middle of a drought or other unfavorable conditions may develop into infective larvae in the feces but without moisture cannot move away from the pat where they can be consumed by a host animal when it eats grass. Eggs that are shed during favorable conditions can develop into infective larvae in just a few days if temperatures are warm and moisture is plentiful. Once consumed by cattle, the infective larvae mature into adults over a period of 3-4 weeks (shorter in younger cattle, longer in adult cattle) and begin to lay eggs, which are shed onto pastures to start the cycle over again. Some larvae can become inhibited or hypobiotic (go into hibernation) in the wall of the abomasum, sometimes referred to as L4 larvae. This process can occur during the winter in the north and in the summer in the south, with these larvae maturing and developing into adult worms when the environment for egg survival is more favorable. Overall, the controlling of internal parasites has a significant positive return on investment for producers. The main focus of internal parasite control in beef cattle is roundworms. Diagnostics are needed to determine which specific worms are present. For beef cattle this is important because the roundworm life cycle depends on the shedding of the eggs on pasture, larvae development, and the ingestion of the larvae during grazing. Since much of beef cattle production depends on grazing of pastures, the management of roundworms is key. As long as cattle have access to grass, they will have an internal parasite challenge. Control practices should consider the class (or age) of cattle, nutrition status, stress level, season, and likelihood of parasite contamination of the environment, and involve the use of pasture management options as well as the use of anthelmintic (dewormer) products for treatment. Life-Cycle of Internal Parasites “Lifecycle of a typical roundworm”, https://www.progressivecattle.com/topics/management/parasite-control-in-stocker-and-grower-cattle Infective L3 larvae in a drop of dew enter the cow’s mouth when eating grass. Ingested larvae penetrate the stomach and pass in the lymph to the lungs. Adults live in lungs and lay eggs. Eggs are coughed into mouth from lungs and swallowed. Eggs hatch to larvae as they pass through intestines. L1 larvae on fungus grow in dung pat. L2 larvae live in dung pat. L3 larvae move onto grass where they again can be ingested by cows. Parasite Contamination Susceptibility PRIORITIZED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PARASITES ENVIRONMENTAL PARASITE CONTAMINATION LIKELIHOOD Calves > Yearlings > Adult bulls > Adult cows Spring / Early summer > Late summer (dry season) > Winter Nutritionally challenged > Not nutritionally challenged Continuously grazed pasture > Rested pasture > Not grazed / Hayed pasture > Recently tilled > Dry lot Stressed (newly weaned, heat/cold stress, etc) > Not stressed Some pasture management activities may include leaving the pasture fallow, grazing other species, and dragging manure pats during the dry season to allow them to dry out. Anthelmintics used to control internal parasites for beef cattle come in several forms including paste, injectable, drench, pour-on, bolus, and as a feed or mineral additive. Products have varying lengths of activity and costs, but fall into two main classes: benzimidazoles and macrocylic lactones. Benzimidazoles (white dewormers) available commercially contain albendazole, fenbendazole, or oxfendazole. Benzimidazoles are effective against most of the major adult gastrointestinal parasites and many of the larval stages. Products come in various oral formulations and have a short duration of efficacy. Macrocyclic lactones are the avermectins and milbemycins. Products in commercial use contain ivermectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, or moxidectin. The macrocyclic lactones have a potent, broad antiparasitic spectrum at low dose levels. They are active against many larval stages (including hypobiotic larvae) and are active against many external parasites as well. Products are available as oral, subcutaneous, and pour-on formulations for use in cattle. Duration of efficacy varies with the product and may be up to 35 days. Approaches used to treat parasites in beef cattle are considered strategic deworming. This is the practice of treating cattle at times to not only get the benefit in that animal to prevent economic loss but also reduce environmental contamination for a period of time at least equal to the life cycle of the parasite removed. Keys to strategic deworming are to place cattle that are not shedding eggs on pastures that are not infected; this is accomplished by deworming prior to spring turnout or fall treatment in the north (following killing frost). The benefit of treating in the fall is that cattle should be free of internal parasites all winter and going into the spring turnout (assuming an effective product was used). Cattle that go onto pasture at spring turnout are free of parasites, thus not shedding eggs, and will be consuming the infective larvae on the pasture if the pasture is contaminated. By consuming the infective larvae and not shedding new ones the cows will be reducing the load on the pasture (acting as vacuum cleaners). After a time the ingested infective larvae will mature and cows will start shedding eggs. Strategic deworming times the treatment so as to reduce the worm burden on the cattle and also decrease the parasite contamination of the pasture during the highest parasite period (spring/early summer). The timing of these treatments can and should be timed with other management procedures such as summer vaccines for the calves and fall processing of calves and cows. Depending on the geographic location, such as in the south where the weather (moisture) is different, timings may be different, as well as the type of grazing program. Calves and stockers should be considered within a strategic program while on a grazing program. Times of concern include prior to weaning while nursing the cow and while intensively grazing as a stocker. Calves should not be dewormed while being weaned. Preweaning treatment, prior to the stress of weaning, can reduce the potential negative impact on immune function as well as improve performance. Any time cattle are moving from pasture into a dry lot setting is a good time to deworm as this should clear cattle of parasite load for the time in the dry lot (similar to fall deworming) as there is no green grass to graze. For the control of other types of internal parasites such as tapeworms (cestodes), flukes (trematodes), and protozoans (such as coccidia), similar concepts are applied. It is important to understand the different life cycles of these different types of parasites as well as the efficacy of products used to treat them. External Parasites The major external parasites that affect cattle include flies, grubs, lice, ticks, and mites. These external parasites feed on body tissues such as blood and skin, and in addition they cause irritation and discomfort that result in reduced weight gain and lost production. Parasites that take blood meals have the potential to serve as vectors for the transmission of diseases. Horn Flies Horn flies are blood-sucking flies that stay on the shoulders and backs of cattle almost continuously. A horn fly leaves the back of a cow or calf only to lay eggs in fresh manure. They take blood meals from the host 24 hours a day. Face Flies Face flies cluster on the faces of cattle and feed on secretions from the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and lips. Face flies do not suck blood. They do irritate the surface of the eyeball and may carry pathogens that contribute to pinkeye problems. They spend only a small portion of their life on cattle. Stable Flies Stable flies feed primarily on the legs and lower abdomen of cattle and take blood meals two to three times a day depending on the weather. After feeding they move to a resting place to digest the blood meal. Stable flies are associated with substantial economic loss in cattle from the blood loss and pain from feeding. As few as five flies per leg is economically significant in cattle. Ticks Ticks cause blood loss and discomfort, and can act as vectors for disease spread. High concentrations of ticks usually occur in brushy pastures and woodlands. Lice Lice that affect cattle are either of the biting or sucking type, and cause skin irritation and itching. The entire life cycle of lice is on the host and they are present year round but populations increase in winter months. Lice spread through contact with infested cattle. Infested cattle can experience reduced appetite and anemia, and appear unthrifty. Mites In cattle, mites can cause hair loss and a thickening of the skin. Infestation by mites is called mange. Mites are spread by close contact. Severe mange can weaken cattle and make them vulnerable to diseases. Certain types of mites are reportable. Cattle Grubs (warbles) Cattle grubs, or warbles, are the larval stage of the heel fly. The larvae migrate from the animal’s heel, where the eggs are deposited by the adult fly in early summer, to the back of the animal. The larvae can cause damage to the hide (due to the breathing hole they create) and if treated during the wrong time of the year can cause paralysis due to their location near the spinal column. Cattle should not be treated with a grubicide between November 15 and March 1 if cattle grubs are a concern . Control of External Parasites Control of external parasites usually revolves around the use of insecticides. These usually are a pyrethrin or an organophosphate. Strategies or combinations of strategies for delivery include: dust bags, back-rubbers (oilers), animal sprays, pour-ons, and insecticide impregnated ear tags. In addition, the use of injectable products or pour-ons with systemic activity work well to control lice and mites. Larvicides can also be part of control plan for certain types of flies as well as the use of predator wasps and environmental management. The use of dust bags and back-rubbers (oilers) can provide delivery of insecticides and economic fly control if located in an area that cattle are forced to move through such as a gateway or over a mineral feeder. Delivery of Insecticides “Insecticide cattle care”, http://easywaycattlecare.com/images/walkway-3.jpg Insecticide sprays and pour-ons are effective for many different external parasites but have the drawback of increased animal handling costs and stress during the fly-season. Insecticide sprays are the only way to manage adult stable flies. Ear tags impregnated with insecticide can be effective in fly control. Maximizing control requires two tags per animal, and timing of application with peak fly numbers often requires a separate handling session of the animals. Ear tags provide good face fly control if applied properly. Insecticide Ear Tag Fly Control “Corathon insecticide cattle ear tags”, https://www.pbsanimalhealth.com/products/corathon-insecticde-cattle-ear-tags Larvicides prevent fly larvae from developing in to adults and are administered through free choice mineral. To be effective cattle must consume an adequate amount and not be in the proximity of untreated cattle. Injectable products and pour-ons with systemic activity are mainly the macrocyclic lactones. These are effective against some flies as well as mites and lice. For mites and lice a second treatment may be needed in two to three weeks to kill newly hatched parasites unless using an extended duration product. Sanitation or cleaning up of wasted feed or manure that serve as egg-laying sites for certain flies can greatly contribute to the control of certain flies locally. In addition, egg laying sites may be treated with a larvicide. Environmental management may be a key component to tick control. The reduction of brushy areas and thick wooded areas reduces the habitat for the ticks and reduces exposure. Certain native parasitic wasps are used as biological control agents of fly populations. Currently, farmers can buy parasitic wasps from commercial insectaries. These wasps emerge into adulthood from the pupal stage, where they develop wings. They fly from the release stations in which they have been held, hung from barn ceilings or other out-of-reach places. The wasps only target flies in their pupal stage. When the wasp finds a pupa in soil or litter, she inserts her stinger and withdraws it, drawing blood and paralyzing the pupa and inserting one egg. The egg hatches after 1 day, and the larva feeds on body fluids and organs for 2-4 weeks. Eventually, the wasp chews its way out of the dead host’s puparium and flies away as an adult. Example Strategic Control Program “Strategic Control: Beef Monograph”, http://www.midamericaagresearch.net/documents/BeefMonograph.pdf Stocker, yearling and replacement heifers dewormed at turnout, four and eight weeks after onset of grazing (0-4-8). Cow/calf deworming six weeks after onset of grazing. If cattle were not dewormed in the fall, adult cows should be dewormed at pasture turnout and again six weeks after onset of grazing. All cattle retained over winter should be dewormed. During lice season, two treatments two to three weeks apart may be necessary. Grub treatment three to four months after the end of heel fly season, varies south to north. Requires systemic, annual control only. Cattle grazed along the Gulf Coast and Northwest coast should be treated for adult and immature liver flukes. (Horn-fly control as needed to keep populations below 200 flies per animal.) There is increasing evidence of antiparasitic resistance in grazing species, such as cattle, small ruminants (sheep and goats), and horses, both globally and within the United States. Antiparasitic resistance is the genetic ability of parasites to survive treatment with an antiparasitic drug that was generally effective against those parasites in the past. Many factors contribute to antiparasitic resistance, including the biology of the parasite; the immune status of the host animal; treatment practices; drug properties; and certain livestock management practices. To help combat this emerging problem, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine started the Antiparasitic Resistance Management Strategy (ARMS) . Dairy Cattle As in beef cattle, the overarching theme for the prevention strategy of parasitic infection is to reduce the animals’ exposure to parasites and their infectious forms. Because multiple animals will be exposed, any strategy will focus on entire groups of animals rather than individuals. So far, this is similar to prevention strategies for any other infectious diseases on farm. However, when thinking about the pre...

Molecules 1.4: The Scientific Method: How Chemists Think Use the following paragraph to answer the first two questions. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died. Which of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming’s hypothesis? Nutrient broth kills bacteria. There are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn\\'t grow. Mold kills bacteria. Penicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus. Without mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria. Fleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria. What step in the scientific method does this represent? Collecting and organizing data Making a hypothesis Testing a hypothesis by experiment Rejecting the old hypothesis and making a new one None of these A scientific investigation is NOT valid unless every step in the scientific method is present and carried out in the exact order listed in this chapter. True False Which of the following words is closest to the same meaning as hypothesis ? fact law formula suggestion conclusion Why do scientists sometimes discard theories? the steps in the scientific method were not followed in order public opinion disagrees with the theory the theory is opposed by the church contradictory observations are found congress voted against it Gary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day, that were the same size when planted, were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the same size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they had the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary’s hypothesis? Different plants have different characteristics. Plants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine. Plants that grow in the shade grow larger. Plants that don’t receive water will die. Plants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same? Gary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth. Gary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment. Gary want to control how much plant food his plants received. Gary wanted his garden to look organized. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers. What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday? Gary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants. Gary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth. Gary\\'s hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth. Gary was conserving water. There is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day. What was the variable being tested in Gary\\'s experiment? the amount of water the amount of plant food the amount of soil the amount of sunshine the type of soil Which of the following factors may be varying in Gary’s experimental setup that he did not control? individual plant variation soil temperature due to different colors of containers water loss due to evaporation from the soil the effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other All of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control. When a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host\\'s skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment? to prove that the lice carried the typhus virus to prove the monkey was similar to man to prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus to prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus the workers were mean Eijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman’s hypothesis? Polyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens. White rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis. Unpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus. The rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis. None of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman\\'s hypothesis. The three questions below relate to the following paragraphs. Scientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks. Scientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A\\'s suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area. Which of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation? The only animals living in the area were giraffes. The only available food was on tall trees. Animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. A, B, and C are all interpretations. A, B, and C are all observations. Scientist A\\'s hypothesis was that the only animals living in the area were giraffes. the only available food was on tall trees. animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks. the animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species. None of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A\\'s hypothesis. Scientist A\\'s hypothesis being discarded is evidence that the scientific method doesn’t always work. a result achieved without use of the scientific method. an example of what happened before the scientific method was invented. an example of the normal functioning of the scientific method. an unusual case. When a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law. True False During Pasteur\\'s time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livelihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have invented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier\\'s claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier\\'s hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier\\'s cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier\\'s cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D? So that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from. To make sure the injection actually contained anthrax. To serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows). To kill as many cows as possible. A hypothesis is a description of a consistent pattern in observations. an observation that remains constant. a theory that has been proven. a tentative explanation for a phenomenon. A number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence? Everyone who ate oysters got sick. People got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked. Symptoms included nausea and dizziness. The cook felt really bad about it. Bacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness. Which statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls? Experimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes. Experimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests. Experimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed. Experimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable. A student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The five seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment? The student has too few pots. The student has two independent variables. The student has two dependent variables. The student has no experimental control on the soil. A scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment? Corn without fertilizer. Corn with fertilizer. Amount of water. Height of corn plants. If you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true? There can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences, or else the experiment is invalid. The control group and the test group may have many differences between them. The control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable. None of these are true. If the hypothesis is rejected by the experiment, then: the experiment may have been a success. the experiment was a failure. the experiment was poorly designed. the experiment didn\\'t follow the scientific method. A well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world is a: theory. law. hypothesis. None of these. 1.5: A Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed 1.E: Exercises is shared under a CK-12 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.

GAIA 3 None Here\\'s a fun riddle that I think you\\'ll enjoy.\\n\\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected. GAIA 3 None My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring.

GAIA Louvrier None You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count\\'s advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\\n\\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It\\'s a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day.

The only rule restricting the host\\'s coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob\\'s guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins.

You begin to ask yourself: What am I going to make this week? Will the kids even eat it? Will it fit in the budget? Will the store have everything I need? …Where do I start? Making complicated healthy recipes sounds— not so fun— for you or your wallet. I want to help show you that eating “healthy” does not have to be complicated and if planned out, is much easier than you may think. It may take time to find your “groove” but once you do I promise you will feel so much better. Don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. I am going to share with you our “staple” grocery list items that our family enjoys. *Reminder that I have Celiac and most everything we buy is gluten-free, but we do buy the occasional “glutenous” items for Spencer and Marlie! Below, I have broken down each major food category and why these foods are important. Fruits Yes, fruits are actually considered a carb, but do not let that scare you. Fruits contain many essential vitamins and minerals and most are very hydrating and full of water. They make for a good snack or dessert! We also use tons of fruit for our protein shakes/smoothies. We always have tons of fruit in our house and they are an easy grab and go snack. Marlie never leaves the house without an apple or banana in hand. Also you can try and freezing fruit like grapes, and eating them like candy! Our must-have fruits: 1. Apples 2. Bananas 3. Strawberries 4. Blueberries 5. Raspberries 6. Pears 7. Watermelon 8. Clementines 9.Avocados *One thing to note here is I do not buy all of these at once. I look for what is on sale or in season so they are the best tasting and easiest on my wallet!* Vegetables Veggies are nutritional superstars. (Although not all veggies are created equal.) That’s why veggies are so essential. Not only are they packed with nutrients, vitamins, and minerals but they are low in calories, filling and delicious. The bulk of your plate/meal should be veggies. In our house, we love to build “superfood” bowls and try and pack a variety of different veggies in one. If you follow my instagram story,  We love to dip our veggies in bitchin sauce (we are obsessed) or hummus. we always try and have a veggie/fruit for a snack. Our must-have veggies: 1. Spinach 2. Bell peppers 3. Cucumbers 4. Carrots 5. Tomatoes 6. Mushrooms 7. Leafy Greens 8. Broccoli 9. Onions 10.squash *one thing I do to get more veggies for Mar is to add spinach to muffins , smoothies and when I cook ground beef or turkey, I sauté tons of spinach and mushrooms with it and chip it up so she has no idea* Protein There are tons of different ways to get protein in your diet. In our household, we eat a variety of different meats, nuts, eggs and grains. I would say we spend the most money on our meats. I try to buy the highest quality meats whenever I can. Another great way to up your protein intake is with a protein supplement— I like to use bob’s redmill protein powder and sports research collagen peptides vanilla . (Remember that collagen peptides are not a complete protein and should not replace a protein powder). Protein is extremely important for building lean muscle, getting stronger, and reaching your fitness goals. Our must-haves proteins: 1. Chicken breast 2. Lean Ground Turkey 3. Albacore Tuna 4. Eggs 5. Almond butter 6.Aidell’s chicken sausage 7. bob’s redmill protein powder 8. sports research collagen peptides vanilla Dairy We are mostly dairy-free in our house, although Marlie and Spencer enjoy cheese! I do not do well with dairy, but I do like the occasional quesadilla. haha. You can find many non-dairy sources of calcium if you do not enjoy dairy . Our dairy must-haves: 1. Unsweetened Vanilla Almond milk 2. Babybell’s 3.shredded Colby jack cheese Carbs Not all carbs are “bad”. “Good” carbs are ones that are not heavily refined. They contain a lot of fiber and are complex. These types of carbohydrates take longer to break down inside your body. We try to not have any refined carbs in our house (cookies, cinnamon rolls, white bread, etc.) Being gluten-free isn’t necessarily “healthier” if you just eat all of the gluten free products (they are normally higher in sugar). Here are our must-have carbs: 1.Quinoa 2.Rice 3. Cybele’s pasta 4. Schar gluten-free bread 5. Bob’s Redmill GF steel cut oats 6. Potatoes 7. Siete tortillas 8. Naan (for Spencer) Snacks As mentioned above, most of our snacks are fruits and veggies with our favorite bitchin sauce or hummus. Some other snacks we like to take on the go with us are: Perfect bars Lara bars RX bars SHINE organic superfood pouches Late July chips Siete chips Our “Must-Have” Healthy Grocery list items motherhood , blog , grocery Taylor Merritt October 29, 2018 healthy , grocery , shopping , eating , cooking , fruit , veggies , carbs , snakcs , grocery store 5 Comments Facebook 0 Twitter LinkedIn 0 Reddit Tumblr Pinterest 0 0 Likes Previous What it takes to Burn off your favorite Halloween Candy blog Taylor Merritt October 31, 2018 halloween candy, halloween, workout Next Tips for Staying on Track While Traveling blog, bodyweight workouts Taylor Merritt October 22, 2018 hotel workout, travel workout sweatyasamother@gmail.com Hours About Contact Media Powered by Squarespace\n",

I've pickled up a few helpful tips and tricks along the way. In this post, I'm sharing my go-to Vegetarian Grocery List, along with best practices for saving money on groceries. Heading to the grocery store shouldn't stress you out. Use this guide to stock up your kitchen with ease instead! How to Use This Grocery List Understand that this list is only intended to be a general guide. Buy only what works for you and your family and leave the rest behind. You don't need to purchase everything on the list. It's totally fine to stock your pantry gradually over time. Include foods that fit your preferences and cultural traditions, and eliminate those that don't. This list is based on the foods that I personally like to keep in my kitchen. You'll probably like to stock some different items and that's great! Include a few \"fun foods,\" especially in the snack and dessert department. Eating plant-based doesn't mean you have to feel restricted or deprived! Be sure to add ingredients for any recipes or new dishes you want to try. I have a free guide with 100+ vegetarian ideas if you need some help getting started! Vegetarian Grocery List Download a printable version of this grocery list here. Fresh Produce 1-2 dark leafy greens (i.e. spinach, kale) Onions Garlic Carrots Tomatoes 2-4 \"dinner vegetables\" (i.e. broccoli, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, bell peppers, asparagus, potatoes, sweet potatoes) Bananas Avocado Lemons Limes 1-2 seasonal fruits (i.e. oranges, apples, berries) Fresh herbs (i.e. basil, cilantro, parsley) Jalapeño peppers Dates Bakery Bread and/or buns/sandwich rolls Tortillas (small for tacos, large for burritos and wraps) Dessert Grains and Pulses Pasta Oats Rice Rice noodles Popcorn 1-2 additional whole grains (i.e. farro, barley, quinoa) Lentils Dry beans or peas Nuts and Seeds Peanut butter or nut butter (i.e. almond butter, cashew butter) Tahini Chia seeds Flaxseeds 1-2 additional nuts and seeds (i.e. walnuts, pecans, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds) Canned Goods 2-3 canned beans (i.e. chickpeas, black beans, kidney beans) Canned tomatoes Canned coconut milk Other Pantry Staples Flour Baking powder Baking soda Sugar Maple syrup Nutritional yeast Shredded coconut Extra virgin olive oil 1-2 cooking oils (i.e. grapeseed oil, coconut oil, avocado oil) 2-3 vinegars (i.e. apple cider vinegar, rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar) Spices and dried herbs (i.e. garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, chili powder, curry powder, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, salt, pepper) Vanilla extract Soy sauce Condiments (i.e. ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) Vegetable broth Olives Fruit spread Chocolate chips Snacks/Convenience Foods Tortilla chips and salsa Dried fruit Prepared soups Energy bars Cereal or granola Beverages Coffee Matcha Caffeine-free herbal tea Sparkling water Refrigerated Foods Tofu Tempeh Milk of choice (i.e. oat milk, soy milk, almond milk, cow's milk) Yogurt and/or dairy-free yogurt alternative Butter Cheese Eggs Miso Fermented pickled vegetables (i.e. kimchi, sauerkraut) Hummus Frozen Foods 2-3 frozen vegetables (i.e. corn, peas, spinach, broccoli) 1-2 frozen fruits (i.e. wild blueberries, tropical fruit blend) Edamame Frozen convenience foods (i.e. frozen cheese/veggie pizza, frozen bean burritos, frozen bean burgers) Ice cream or dairy-free frozen dessert Other Kitchen Essentials Paper towels Dish soap Parchment paper and/or aluminum foil Printable Vegetarian Grocery List For your convenience, I also created a printable, PDF version of this vegetarian grocery list. Access the printable grocery list here. Grocery Shopping Tips Make a List and Plan Some Meals in Advance The first step of any successful grocery store outing is to have a plan. Use this grocery list to get you started with the basics. Also, plan a few recipes or meals that you want to make during the week ahead, and add any necessary ingredients to your list. If you need some recipe ideas, I have a free resource with 100+ Vegetarian Meal Prep Ideas . My ebook, Easy Vegetarian Meal Prep , is another helpful guide to keep on hand. Look for Seasonal Produce Choosing seasonal produce is a smart way to save on groceries while maximizing flavor and nutrient content. Check out my seasonal produce guide for more information. Only Buy What You'll Use Especially when it comes to produce and fresh bakery, try to only buy what you'll actually use to reduce food waste . Supplement fresh foods with canned goods and frozen items to hold you over until your next trip to the store. If you accidentally buy too much, you can freeze most types of fresh produce and baked goods so they last longer. Making a big batch of soup is a great way to use up extra veggies, too! DON'T Only Shop the Perimeter Have you ever heard that you should only shop the perimeter of the grocery store? This advice is completely outdated! There are so many nutritious and convenient items in the central aisles of most grocery stores. This is where you'll usually find healthy pantry staples like oats, canned beans, rice, olive oil, and chia seeds. Don't skip this part of the store! Check the Bulk Section If you're stocking up on pantry staples, don't forget to check the bulk section. You can often save money on items purchased in bulk and you can also bring your own reusable containers to reduce packaging waste. Balance Price and Convenience Understand that there's usually a price for convenience. For example, a package of chopped butternut squash will probably cost more than a whole squash that you have to cut up yourself. Neither of these is necessarily a bad choice—you just have to weigh out the pros and cons. Is saving money or spending less time prepping your meals more important to you in this phase of life? DON'T Skip Convenience Foods and Fun Foods Have you ever stocked up on tons of healthy ingredients and then felt like you have nothing to eat as soon as you get home? I know I've been there. You're probably not always going to feel like prepping a bunch of meals and snacks from scratch, and that's okay. I like to buy a couple of convenience foods (canned soups and a frozen pizza are my go-to's) in case I don't have the time or energy to cook all of the time. Besides keeping hunger at bay, including a few convenient meals and snacks could actually save you money in the long run because you won't need to order takeout or delivery. Bring Reusable Bags Last but not least, because we can always use another reminder, don't forget your reusable bags! 🙂 Save This Guide on Pinterest 63 shares Share Pin Flipboard Tweet Post navigation Previous Previous 5-Minute Walnut Pesto Next Continue Vegetarian Pesto Pasta with Veggies More From the Blog: Yogurt Toast with 3 Topping Ideas Have you tried the latest yogurt toast trend?

They are on my meal plans , and at the base of practically every meal I improvise . Most of them are robust enough to keep well in the refrigerator for two or more weeks, which means that I can stock enough in the produce drawer to know I can cook up any meal without a recipe . Combined with a few of my other vegan pantry staples (the 75 ingredients I make sure to always have at hand), they form the base of our meals, and of our good health. Here they are, the vegetables always on my vegan grocery list: Red onions Practically everything I cook in a week starts with chopping a red onion. They are inexpensive nutritional powerhouses that fight cancer and many other diseases , and they deepen the flavor of every savory dish one can imagine. I prefer red onions because they are sweet and have more phytonutrients, as the bright-colored skin and layers demonstrate. I always keep at least 3-5 red onions in the fridge. In the winter, which are mild here in Vancouver (usually a bit above freezing), I buy a big bag of them and keep it on our deck. (If you live in a colder place, keep them in the garage so they don’t freeze.) Chopping onions when they are cold, as opposed to room temperature, prevents uncontrollable crying. Save time (and your fingers) Proper chopping technique will save you hours every month. Make sure to review my blog post on basic knife skills . Garlic Garlic is another vegetable on my vegan grocery list that I always, always, always make sure to stock upon. I wouldn’t want to make soup, stews, stir-fries, risottos, or, well, anything, without it. Not only garlic helps prevent the common cold and cancer , but it adds depth and flavor to my meals. If a recipe calls for 1 clove, I usually use 3. I prefer purple garlic because the large, even-sized cloves are faster to split and mince, and the flavor is milder when served raw. As much as possible, I buy it from a local source and avoid the imported white garlic. Big cheap bags of peeled garlic cloves are easy to find these days but unfortunately (in my experience) they don’t taste like much. Don’t let the price or convenience sway you, it’s not worth it. Common advice says to store garlic on the countertop in a special clay pot, but I just put mine in the refrigerator’s butter compartment (which conveniently contains no butter in our home). Health-boosting tip Dr. Greger recommends using the “hack and hold” method to maximize the health benefits of garlic . I just chop the garlic first and let it sit on the side while I chop the onions, so it has maximized its allicin production by the time I throw it in the hot skillet. Ginger Ginger shows up in three to five of my dinners every week. More associated with Asian and Middle Eastern dishes, it’s usually included in stir-fries, curry, couscous, fried rice, and sauces, such as my personal favorite Friday-night dinner: Coco-peanut noodles . It adds a warming zing that awakens taste buds. In addition, regular ginger consumption reduces muscle soreness – good news for a runner like me! Every few months, I buy it in bulk and dehydrate it along with the inedible parts of a pineapple to make a delicious, zero-waste “ginger-pineapple” fruit infusion. Stop wasting your time peeling ginger! The skin is fine to eat! Just scrub the ginger root like a potato and use the finest side of a box grater (or a microplane) to mince it, skin and all. No-one will be able to tell the difference. If the root is badly shriveled, then by all means chop off the sad parts before mincing. I find organic ginger offers smaller roots but a more potent taste so it requires less. Carrots Yummy carrots are worth paying a few extra bucks for if you can find a consistent source. There is no clear indication that organic carrots are more nutritious than their conventional counterparts, but there has to be something in the way they are grown, handled, and stored that explains how they look better and taste sweeter. In season, I prefer local above all because that’s how I get the freshest tops to make pesto . Cooking increases the health benefits of carrots. Their beta-carotenoids get converted into vitamin A by our bodies, benefiting eye health in particular. They are another vegetable that I rarely peel. A vigorous brush takes care of residual specks of dirt and they’re ready to chop to add to any and all simmered dish. On their own, they make a beautiful soup, too. Roasted, they are perfect in my Warming couscous . Just because they are better-for-us cooked doesn’t mean I never eat them raw. They are a convenient and crunchy vehicle to carry hummus and other bean dips to my mouth. I also love grating them to add a pop of orange to big lunch salads. Combine them with red cabbage, a diced apple, and some pumpkin seeds. Orange sweet potatoes (which you may think of as yam) Let’s clarify something right away: the picture above represents sweet potatoes, and that’s what you should always have on your vegan grocery list. “But isn’t that yam?” you ask. No! Please let me quote what the boss of sweet potatoes, Jenné Clairborne, author of the Sweet Potato Soul blog , says about the difference between sweet potatoes and yams: “Sweet potatoes belong to the morning glory family and are usually orange and sweet with moist, starchy flesh. They are distantly related to potatoes, but they are not nightshades. Sweet potatoes and yams are not at all related. Yams are native to Africa and Asia and have starchy white flesh and gray-brown skin. They aren’t nearly as nutritious as sweet potatoes and have much lower yield.” (Jenné Clairborne, on p. 29 of her Sweet Potato Soul book , which is fantastic by the way.) Jenné further describes 9 varieties of sweet potatoes that can be found in North American grocery stores, and they all sound amazing. Usually, garnet sweet potatoes similar to the ones in the picture are the ones I purchase. And don’t peel them! A vigorous brushing will do. The skin has 10 times the phytonutrients as the flesh, which is almost as much as blueberries. I have two favorite uses for sweet potatoes. The first is to make them into a peanutty stew with chickpeas (there’s a recipe for it in my free 2-week vegan meal plan … although they are mislabeled as “yam” on the shopping list! oops). The second is simply to halve and roast them (let’s say 40 minutes at 375 degrees F) and top with a simple black bean stew (onion, garlic, black beans, with cumin, oregano, and a bit of chipotle pepper for seasoning), with a drizzle of cashew cream. YUM! They are a good item to roast as part of a “ minimum viable prep ” on the weekend and serve with bowls. Alternative use Do like Dr. Greger and cook two sweet potatoes in the microwave before leaving the house on a cold day. Pop them in your pockets to serve as handwarmers, and enjoy them as a snack later! Cauliflower, broccoli, and other cruciferous vegetables There always has to be cruciferous veggies on my vegan grocery list. Not only they are a category of their own on the Daily Dozen , for their many health benefits, but they provide a broad diversity of flavors from bitter to sweet, along with a dose of crunch. Colorful, too! A handful of broccoli florets can be thrown into the pasta’s boiling water to make a simple, tasty, and nutritious pasta dish . Cauliflower can always be roasted with a sprinkle of spices for a satisfying addition to vegan salads , although I am always surprised at how sweet it is raw, too. Cauliflower is a bit more robust than broccoli so I often buy it “just in case.” Time-saving tip Cauliflower can be a little harder to cut into florets than broccoli… so often I don’t! If I’m in the slightest rush, I just chop the whole head of cauliflower, stem included, into roughly 1-inch dice. It’s just fine for soups and stews of all kinds. I do prefer individual florets for roasting however. If you need ideas to cook them creatively, check out my collection of cruciferous veggie recipes . Kale (preferably Lacinato/dinosaur/black) Another cruciferous veggie that’s worth buying every single week! Kales is an essential ingredient of my smoothies but also shows up in simmered dishes (such as my mom’s bolo sauce ), tofu scrambles, bowls, and salads . The bigger the pieces, the more you should massage them to break down their tough fibers. One quick way to do it is to wash the leaves under running water, rip the tender parts off the stem, and pile them on top of a clean tea towel. Roll and wring the towel as hard as you can. It’s great exercise for your hands and gets the job done quickly and cleanly. Less food waste, more nutrition Why throw away the tough stems? Just slice them thinly and add ad the same time as the onion when starting your dish. They have all the same nutrients as the leaves, and extra fiber. It’s one of my favorite natural nutrition boosters . I prefer Lacinato kale (also called “black” or “dinosaur”) for a very practical reason: the leaves are flatter and fit better in my fridge, especially when it’s super full after shopping for groceries on the weekend. But the best strategy is to vary which kind you buy ( and eat! ) every week, to enjoy a full range of different nutrients and gustatory experiences. If you are just getting started, buy a single bunch (usually 5 to 7 leaves) and aim to eat at least one leaf per person per day. Mushrooms Mushrooms contain even more water per weight than most vegetables, but they pack many phytochemicals that are likely to have great health benefits . So why not eat more? Plus, they provide a nice variety in texture and mouthfeel that can both enhance vegan dishes and allow them to stand on their own as the main act, like grilled portobello caps. Allowed to breathe in a paper bag, mushrooms will keep for a solid week and perhaps a little longer in your fridge. I always have them on hand to add to stir-fries and Asian-style noodly soups, or sauté for a quick topping on top of risotto or any pasta sauce . Friday night dinner at my home almost always contain them as the “last veggies standing” from the produce drawer, along with some cabbage, in a nutty sauce . Cabbage Why isn’t everyone eating cabbage all the time? It’s so good! And so cheap. I wish I had a second fridge to stock at least two heads at all times: one red and one green. I find red cabbage to be a better fit to add color, crunch, and nutrition to bowls and salads (even better when combined with grated carrots, see above). The green type turns decadently sweet (while being nothing but healthy) when grilled in 1-inch thick slices with a pinch of salt. But since I am short on space, I usually go for a not-too-big head of red cabbage that we chop at through the week. For more info on the health benefits of cabbage, see the section on cruciferous veggies above and my cruciferous-veg recipe collection . Pre-washed power greens I hate to admit it because I try hard to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use , but when I don’t have the opportunity to visit the farmers’ market to buy baby greens in bulk I often turn to boxed or bagged pre-washed power greens from the grocery store. I look for those with kale, chard, and spinach, or other more-robust greens, as opposed to “mixed greens” or “salad greens” which contain more lettuce and tend to wilt faster. Whatever you are cooking, just add a handful. It’ll wilt right in! If you’d rather have multiple dishes on the table, put a giant handful in a side bowl for a salad, add some grated carrot and shredded red cabbage, plus a few bonus salad ingredients from your vegan pantry staples , such as raisins and hemp seeds. Have them for breakfast, too! Combine with juicy fruit (apple, orange, and pineapple come to mind) and a pitted date or two, plus plant milk, and just a minute later you have a bright green smoothie. Unlike the other veggies from my vegan grocery list above, these have a much shorter lifespan in the fridge. But even if you live alone, if you eat as many green veggies as you should, you should make it through a box in four days. If there’s any left over after that, just add extra to your smoothie. Bring it all together: dinner to improvise using these vegetables from your vegan grocery list and pantry ingredients Those 10 types of vegetables are always on my vegan grocery list because they are robust and can be combined with the vegan pantry staples I always stock to make an infinite number of improvised dinners.

In your Vegan Experiment from Momentum 2021, I was left thinking we need to expand the diversity of our regular vegetable shortlist. Though you have some of our favorites included here. We need more ginger in our lives. And we’ll try the kale. We love Baby Bella mushrooms. May need to expand our range. Brigitte on January 8, 2021 at 4:23 pm Bring on the ginger!

You begin to ask yourself: What am I going to make this week? Will the kids even eat it? Will it fit in the budget? Will the store have everything I need? …Where do I start? Making complicated healthy recipes sounds— not so fun— for you or your wallet. I want to help show you that eating “healthy” does not have to be complicated and if planned out, is much easier than you may think. It may take time to find your “groove” but once you do I promise you will feel so much better. Don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. I am going to share with you our “staple” grocery list items that our family enjoys. *Reminder that I have Celiac and most everything we buy is gluten-free, but we do buy the occasional “glutenous” items for Spencer and Marlie! Below, I have broken down each major food category and why these foods are important. Fruits Yes, fruits are actually considered a carb, but do not let that scare you. Fruits contain many essential vitamins and minerals and most are very hydrating and full of water. They make for a good snack or dessert! We also use tons of fruit for our protein shakes/smoothies. We always have tons of fruit in our house and they are an easy grab and go snack. Marlie never leaves the house without an apple or banana in hand. Also you can try and freezing fruit like grapes, and eating them like candy! Our must-have fruits: 1. Apples 2. Bananas 3. Strawberries 4. Blueberries 5. Raspberries 6. Pears 7. Watermelon 8. Clementines 9.Avocados *One thing to note here is I do not buy all of these at once. I look for what is on sale or in season so they are the best tasting and easiest on my wallet!* Vegetables Veggies are nutritional superstars. (Although not all veggies are created equal.) That’s why veggies are so essential. Not only are they packed with nutrients, vitamins, and minerals but they are low in calories, filling and delicious. The bulk of your plate/meal should be veggies. In our house, we love to build “superfood” bowls and try and pack a variety of different veggies in one. If you follow my instagram story,\\xa0 We love to dip our veggies in bitchin sauce (we are obsessed) or hummus. we always try and have a veggie/fruit for a snack. Our must-have veggies: 1. Spinach 2. Bell peppers 3. Cucumbers 4. Carrots 5. Tomatoes 6.\\xa0Mushrooms 7. Leafy Greens 8. Broccoli 9. Onions 10.squash *one thing I do to get more veggies for Mar is to add spinach to muffins , smoothies and when I cook ground beef or turkey, I sauté tons of spinach and mushrooms with it and chip it up so she has no idea* Protein There are tons of different ways to get protein in your diet. In our household, we eat a variety of different meats, nuts, eggs and grains. I would say we spend the most money on our meats. I try to buy the highest quality meats whenever I can. Another great way to up your protein intake is with a protein supplement— I like to use bob’s redmill protein powder and sports research collagen peptides vanilla . (Remember that collagen peptides are not a complete protein and should not replace a protein powder). Protein is extremely important for building lean muscle, getting stronger, and reaching your fitness goals. Our must-haves proteins: 1. Chicken breast 2. Lean Ground Turkey 3. Albacore Tuna 4.\\xa0Eggs 5. Almond butter 6.Aidell’s chicken sausage 7. bob’s redmill protein powder 8. sports research collagen peptides vanilla Dairy We are mostly dairy-free in our house, although Marlie and Spencer enjoy cheese! I do not do well with dairy, but I do like the occasional quesadilla. haha. You can find many non-dairy sources of calcium if you do not enjoy dairy . Our dairy must-haves: 1. Unsweetened Vanilla Almond milk 2. Babybell’s 3.shredded Colby jack cheese Carbs Not all carbs are “bad”. “Good” carbs are ones that are not heavily refined. They contain a lot of fiber and are complex. These types of carbohydrates take longer to break down inside your body. We try to not have any refined carbs in our house (cookies, cinnamon rolls, white bread, etc.) Being gluten-free isn’t necessarily “healthier” if you just eat all of the gluten free products (they are normally higher in sugar). Here are our must-have carbs: 1.Quinoa 2.Rice 3. Cybele’s pasta 4. Schar gluten-free bread 5. Bob’s Redmill GF steel cut oats 6. Potatoes 7. Siete tortillas 8. Naan (for Spencer) Snacks As mentioned above, most of our snacks are fruits and veggies with our favorite bitchin sauce or hummus. Some other snacks we like to take on the go with us are: Perfect bars Lara bars RX bars SHINE organic superfood pouches Late July chips Siete chips Our “Must-Have” Healthy Grocery list items motherhood , blog , grocery Taylor Merritt October 29, 2018 healthy , grocery , shopping , eating , cooking , fruit , veggies , carbs , snakcs , grocery store 5 Comments Facebook 0 Twitter LinkedIn 0 Reddit Tumblr Pinterest 0 0 Likes Previous What it takes to Burn off your favorite Halloween Candy blog Taylor Merritt October 31, 2018 halloween candy, halloween, workout Next Tips for Staying on Track While Traveling blog, bodyweight workouts Taylor Merritt October 22, 2018 hotel workout, travel workout sweatyasamother@gmail.com Hours About Contact Media Powered by Squarespace\\n\\n---\\nTitle: Vegetarian Grocery List and Shopping Tips From a Registered ...\\nSnippet: Mar 11, 2022 ...

I\\'ve pickled up a few helpful tips and tricks along the way. In this post, I\\'m sharing my go-to Vegetarian Grocery List, along with best practices for saving money on groceries. Heading to the grocery store shouldn\\'t stress you out. Use this guide to stock up your kitchen with ease instead! How to Use This Grocery List Understand that this list is only intended to be a general guide. Buy only what works for you and your family and leave the rest behind. You don\\'t need to purchase everything on the list. It\\'s totally fine to stock your pantry gradually over time. Include foods that fit your preferences and cultural traditions, and eliminate those that don\\'t. This list is based on the foods that I personally like to keep in my kitchen. You\\'ll probably like to stock some different items and that\\'s great! Include a few \"fun foods,\" especially in the snack and dessert department. Eating plant-based doesn\\'t mean you have to feel restricted or deprived! Be sure to add ingredients for any recipes or new dishes you want to try. I have a free guide with 100+ vegetarian ideas if you need some help getting started! Vegetarian Grocery List Download a printable version of this grocery list here.

Access the printable grocery list here. Grocery Shopping Tips Make a List and Plan Some Meals in Advance The first step of any successful grocery store outing is to have a plan. Use this grocery list to get you started with the basics. Also, plan a few recipes or meals that you want to make during the week ahead, and add any necessary ingredients to your list. If you need some recipe ideas, I have a free resource with 100+ Vegetarian Meal Prep Ideas . My ebook, Easy Vegetarian Meal Prep , is another helpful guide to keep on hand. Look for Seasonal Produce Choosing seasonal produce is a smart way to save on groceries while maximizing flavor and nutrient content. Check out my seasonal produce guide for more information. Only Buy What You\\'ll Use Especially when it comes to produce and fresh bakery, try to only buy what you\\'ll actually use to reduce food waste . Supplement fresh foods with canned goods and frozen items to hold you over until your next trip to the store. If you accidentally buy too much, you can freeze most types of fresh produce and baked goods so they last longer. Making a big batch of soup is a great way to use up extra veggies, too! DON\\'T Only Shop the Perimeter Have you ever heard that you should only shop the perimeter of the grocery store? This advice is completely outdated! There are so many nutritious and convenient items in the central aisles of most grocery stores. This is where you\\'ll usually find healthy pantry staples like oats, canned beans, rice, olive oil, and chia seeds. Don\\'t skip this part of the store! Check the Bulk Section If you\\'re stocking up on pantry staples, don\\'t forget to check the bulk section. You can often save money on items purchased in bulk and you can also bring your own reusable containers to reduce packaging waste. Balance Price and Convenience Understand that there\\'s usually a price for convenience. For example, a package of chopped butternut squash will probably cost more than a whole squash that you have to cut up yourself. Neither of these is necessarily a bad choice—you just have to weigh out the pros and cons. Is saving money or spending less time prepping your meals more important to you in this phase of life? DON\\'T Skip Convenience Foods and Fun Foods Have you ever stocked up on tons of healthy ingredients and then felt like you have nothing to eat as soon as you get home? I know I\\'ve been there. You\\'re probably not always going to feel like prepping a bunch of meals and snacks from scratch, and that\\'s okay. I like to buy a couple of convenience foods (canned soups and a frozen pizza are my go-to\\'s) in case I don\\'t have the time or energy to cook all of the time. Besides keeping hunger at bay, including a few convenient meals and snacks could actually save you money in the long run because you won\\'t need to order takeout or delivery. Bring Reusable Bags Last but not least, because we can always use another reminder, don\\'t forget your reusable bags! 🙂 Save This Guide on Pinterest 63 shares Share Pin Flipboard Tweet Post navigation Previous Previous 5-Minute Walnut Pesto Next Continue Vegetarian Pesto Pasta with Veggies More From the Blog: Yogurt Toast with 3 Topping Ideas Have you tried the latest yogurt toast trend?

They are on my meal plans , and at the base of practically every meal I improvise . Most of them are robust enough to keep well in the refrigerator for two or more weeks, which means that I can stock enough in the produce drawer to know I can cook up any meal without a recipe . Combined with a few of my other vegan pantry staples (the 75 ingredients I make sure to always have at hand), they form the base of our meals, and of our good health. Here they are, the vegetables always on my vegan grocery list: Red onions Practically everything I cook in a week starts with chopping a red onion. They are inexpensive nutritional powerhouses that fight cancer and many other diseases , and they deepen the flavor of every savory dish one can imagine. I prefer red onions because they are sweet and have more phytonutrients, as the bright-colored skin and layers demonstrate. I always keep at least 3-5 red onions in the fridge. In the winter, which are mild here in Vancouver (usually a bit above freezing), I buy a big bag of them and keep it on our deck. (If you live in a colder place, keep them in the garage so they don’t freeze.) Chopping onions when they are cold, as opposed to room temperature, prevents uncontrollable crying. Save time (and your fingers) Proper chopping technique will save you hours every month. Make sure to review my blog post on basic knife skills . Garlic Garlic is another vegetable on my vegan grocery list that I always, always, always make sure to stock upon. I wouldn’t want to make soup, stews, stir-fries, risottos, or, well, anything, without it. Not only garlic helps prevent the common cold and cancer , but it adds depth and flavor to my meals. If a recipe calls for 1 clove, I usually use 3. I prefer purple garlic because the large, even-sized cloves are faster to split and mince, and the flavor is milder when served raw. As much as possible, I buy it from a local source and avoid the imported white garlic. Big cheap bags of peeled garlic cloves are easy to find these days but unfortunately (in my experience) they don’t taste like much. Don’t let the price or convenience sway you, it’s not worth it. Common advice says to store garlic on the countertop in a special clay pot, but I just put mine in the refrigerator’s butter compartment (which conveniently contains no butter in our home). Health-boosting tip Dr. Greger recommends using the “hack and hold” method to maximize the health benefits of garlic . I just chop the garlic first and let it sit on the side while I chop the onions, so it has maximized its allicin production by the time I throw it in the hot skillet. Ginger Ginger shows up in three to five of my dinners every week. More associated with Asian and Middle Eastern dishes, it’s usually included in stir-fries, curry, couscous, fried rice, and sauces, such as my personal favorite Friday-night dinner: Coco-peanut noodles . It adds a warming zing that awakens taste buds. In addition, regular ginger consumption reduces muscle soreness – good news for a runner like me! Every few months, I buy it in bulk and dehydrate it along with the inedible parts of a pineapple to make a delicious, zero-waste “ginger-pineapple” fruit infusion. Stop wasting your time peeling ginger! The skin is fine to eat! Just scrub the ginger root like a potato and use the finest side of a box grater (or a microplane) to mince it, skin and all. No-one will be able to tell the difference. If the root is badly shriveled, then by all means chop off the sad parts before mincing. I find organic ginger offers smaller roots but a more potent taste so it requires less. Carrots Yummy carrots are worth paying a few extra bucks for if you can find a consistent source. There is no clear indication that organic carrots are more nutritious than their conventional counterparts, but there has to be something in the way they are grown, handled, and stored that explains how they look better and taste sweeter. In season, I prefer local above all because that’s how I get the freshest tops to make pesto . Cooking increases the health benefits of carrots. Their beta-carotenoids get converted into vitamin A by our bodies, benefiting eye health in particular. They are another vegetable that I rarely peel. A vigorous brush takes care of residual specks of dirt and they’re ready to chop to add to any and all simmered dish. On their own, they make a beautiful soup, too. Roasted, they are perfect in my Warming couscous . Just because they are better-for-us cooked doesn’t mean I never eat them raw. They are a convenient and crunchy vehicle to carry hummus and other bean dips to my mouth. I also love grating them to add a pop of orange to big lunch salads. Combine them with red cabbage, a diced apple, and some pumpkin seeds. Orange sweet potatoes (which you may think of as yam) Let’s clarify something right away: the picture above represents sweet potatoes, and that’s what you should always have on your vegan grocery list. “But isn’t that yam?” you ask. No! Please let me quote what the boss of sweet potatoes, Jenné Clairborne, author of the Sweet Potato Soul blog , says about the difference between sweet potatoes and yams: “Sweet potatoes belong to the morning glory family and are usually orange and sweet with moist, starchy flesh. They are distantly related to potatoes, but they are not nightshades. Sweet potatoes and yams are not at all related. Yams are native to Africa and Asia and have starchy white flesh and gray-brown skin. They aren’t nearly as nutritious as sweet potatoes and have much lower yield.” (Jenné Clairborne, on p. 29 of her Sweet Potato Soul book , which is fantastic by the way.) Jenné further describes 9 varieties of sweet potatoes that can be found in North American grocery stores, and they all sound amazing. Usually, garnet sweet potatoes similar to the ones in the picture are the ones I purchase. And don’t peel them! A vigorous brushing will do. The skin has 10 times the phytonutrients as the flesh, which is almost as much as blueberries. I have two favorite uses for sweet potatoes. The first is to make them into a peanutty stew with chickpeas (there’s a recipe for it in my free 2-week vegan meal plan … although they are mislabeled as “yam” on the shopping list! oops). The second is simply to halve and roast them (let’s say 40 minutes at 375 degrees F) and top with a simple black bean stew (onion, garlic, black beans, with cumin, oregano, and a bit of chipotle pepper for seasoning), with a drizzle of cashew cream. YUM! They are a good item to roast as part of a “ minimum viable prep ” on the weekend and serve with bowls. Alternative use Do like Dr. Greger and cook two sweet potatoes in the microwave before leaving the house on a cold day. Pop them in your pockets to serve as handwarmers, and enjoy them as a snack later! Cauliflower, broccoli, and other cruciferous vegetables There always has to be cruciferous veggies on my vegan grocery list. Not only they are a category of their own on the Daily Dozen , for their many health benefits, but they provide a broad diversity of flavors from bitter to sweet, along with a dose of crunch. Colorful, too! A handful of broccoli florets can be thrown into the pasta’s boiling water to make a simple, tasty, and nutritious pasta dish . Cauliflower can always be roasted with a sprinkle of spices for a satisfying addition to vegan salads , although I am always surprised at how sweet it is raw, too. Cauliflower is a bit more robust than broccoli so I often buy it “just in case.” Time-saving tip Cauliflower can be a little harder to cut into florets than broccoli… so often I don’t! If I’m in the slightest rush, I just chop the whole head of cauliflower, stem included, into roughly 1-inch dice. It’s just fine for soups and stews of all kinds. I do prefer individual florets for roasting however. If you need ideas to cook them creatively, check out my collection of cruciferous veggie recipes . Kale (preferably Lacinato/dinosaur/black) Another cruciferous veggie that’s worth buying every single week! Kales is an essential ingredient of my smoothies but also shows up in simmered dishes (such as my mom’s bolo sauce ), tofu scrambles, bowls, and salads . The bigger the pieces, the more you should massage them to break down their tough fibers. One quick way to do it is to wash the leaves under running water, rip the tender parts off the stem, and pile them on top of a clean tea towel. Roll and wring the towel as hard as you can. It’s great exercise for your hands and gets the job done quickly and cleanly. Less food waste, more nutrition Why throw away the tough stems? Just slice them thinly and add ad the same time as the onion when starting your dish. They have all the same nutrients as the leaves, and extra fiber. It’s one of my favorite natural nutrition boosters . I prefer Lacinato kale (also called “black” or “dinosaur”) for a very practical reason: the leaves are flatter and fit better in my fridge, especially when it’s super full after shopping for groceries on the weekend. But the best strategy is to vary which kind you buy ( and eat! ) every week, to enjoy a full range of different nutrients and gustatory experiences. If you are just getting started, buy a single bunch (usually 5 to 7 leaves) and aim to eat at least one leaf per person per day. Mushrooms Mushrooms contain even more water per weight than most vegetables, but they pack many phytochemicals that are likely to have great health benefits . So why not eat more? Plus, they provide a nice variety in texture and mouthfeel that can both enhance vegan dishes and allow them to stand on their own as the main act, like grilled portobello caps. Allowed to breathe in a paper bag, mushrooms will keep for a solid week and perhaps a little longer in your fridge. I always have them on hand to add to stir-fries and Asian-style noodly soups, or sauté for a quick topping on top of risotto or any pasta sauce . Friday night dinner at my home almost always contain them as the “last veggies standing” from the produce drawer, along with some cabbage, in a nutty sauce . Cabbage Why isn’t everyone eating cabbage all the time? It’s so good! And so cheap. I wish I had a second fridge to stock at least two heads at all times: one red and one green. I find red cabbage to be a better fit to add color, crunch, and nutrition to bowls and salads (even better when combined with grated carrots, see above). The green type turns decadently sweet (while being nothing but healthy) when grilled in 1-inch thick slices with a pinch of salt. But since I am short on space, I usually go for a not-too-big head of red cabbage that we chop at through the week. For more info on the health benefits of cabbage, see the section on cruciferous veggies above and my cruciferous-veg recipe collection . Pre-washed power greens I hate to admit it because I try hard to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use , but when I don’t have the opportunity to visit the farmers’ market to buy baby greens in bulk I often turn to boxed or bagged pre-washed power greens from the grocery store. I look for those with kale, chard, and spinach, or other more-robust greens, as opposed to “mixed greens” or “salad greens” which contain more lettuce and tend to wilt faster. Whatever you are cooking, just add a handful. It’ll wilt right in! If you’d rather have multiple dishes on the table, put a giant handful in a side bowl for a salad, add some grated carrot and shredded red cabbage, plus a few bonus salad ingredients from your vegan pantry staples , such as raisins and hemp seeds. Have them for breakfast, too! Combine with juicy fruit (apple, orange, and pineapple come to mind) and a pitted date or two, plus plant milk, and just a minute later you have a bright green smoothie. Unlike the other veggies from my vegan grocery list above, these have a much shorter lifespan in the fridge. But even if you live alone, if you eat as many green veggies as you should, you should make it through a box in four days. If there’s any left over after that, just add extra to your smoothie. Bring it all together: dinner to improvise using these vegetables from your vegan grocery list and pantry ingredients Those 10 types of vegetables are always on my vegan grocery list because they are robust and can be combined with the vegan pantry staples I always stock to make an infinite number of improvised dinners.

In your Vegan Experiment from Momentum 2021, I was left thinking we need to expand the diversity of our regular vegetable shortlist. Though you have some of our favorites included here. We need more ginger in our lives. And we’ll try the kale. We love Baby Bella mushrooms. May need to expand our range. Brigitte on January 8, 2021 at 4:23 pm Bring on the ginger!

Final product is runny but not overly so, with a consistency closer to syrup. Best thing was how beautifully clear it was providing the pie with a beautiful finish. 03 of 24 Photo by Bobbie Taylor 12/23/2022 I loved this recipe! Turned out great! I did not use fresh strawberries, but frozen unsweetened ones. I ran out, and used 3/4 cup sweetened strawberry halves to add to the mashed mixture. I strained my sliced strawberries to get rid of the excess juice. I used the juice from the bag and from the mashed pulp. Didn't have to add water. I'm incorporating the pulp in my sweetened strawberry container to use in my punch bowl cake. I used the filling for a Jell-O mold with sweetened condensed milk, crushed pineapple, strawberry jello, cool whip, and pecans. The fresher filling brought the mold to another level! Thank you for this recipe! Will definitely be making this again! 04 of 24 Photo by ClassyDish6990 11/24/2022 Thank you fotoe!78, this recipe came out better than expected! An interesting thing to add about the filling is that you can control the color of the finished product by adjusting the heat, which is pretty cool. 05 of 24 Photo by Heather 06/29/2021 06 of 24 Photo by kitkatkf 12/20/2020 Delicious.

Recipes Desserts Desserts By Ingredients Strawberry Desserts Easy Fresh Strawberry Pie You just need 5 ingredients and 30 minutes to make it. By Laurel Randolph Laurel Randolph Laurel has over 10 years of experience developing recipes and writing about food. She is the author of 4 cookbooks, including the bestselling \"The Instant Pot Electric Cookbook.\" Learn about Simply Recipes' Editorial Process Updated February 17, 2025 5 Ratings Print Close Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Jump to recipe My whole life, I’ve never had my fill of strawberries . When berry season rolls around, all I want is perfectly ripe, sweet strawberries day and night. As a kid, my mom would have to cut me off, knowing I’d eat the freshly picked berries from the farm down the road until my stomach ached. And my cravings don’t stop at plain berries, either—strawberry desserts, like strawberry cake and strawberry pie are equally welcome. Fresh strawberry pie frequently appeared on our dining room table during the summer. My mom made an easy version using strawberry gelatin, loaded with big pieces of berries and topped with Cool Whip. It required minimal baking and was served nice and chilled, perfect for summer. I set out to make my own Jell-O-free version that’s as simple as possible. The result is a fresh strawberry pie that requires zero baking and is bursting with strawberry flavor. Instead of gelatin, a simple cornstarch mixture, along with the berries themselves, thickens the filling. A pastry crust is more traditional, but I prefer a crispy cookie crust here. Piled high with whipped cream, it’s a summertime dream. Timing Is Everything While this recipe couldn't be simpler, the timing is key. After adding the cornstarch mixture, the filling needs to be boiled just enough to thicken and turn the mixture clear, then no more. Over-boiling will actually cause the pie filling to lose its thick texture after chilling. Boil the filling just until it turns clear and thickens, as little as 1 minute and no more than 2 minutes. Then be sure to chill the pie for a minimum of four hours—I recommend overnight or longer. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Tips for Make It Ahead This pie will set up the best if you chill it overnight, making it ideal for making ahead. Make the pie (sans whipped cream) up to two days before serving. If you have any smelly things in your fridge, you’ll want to cover the pie tightly with plastic wrap. Add the fresh whipped cream and fresh strawberry garnish just before serving. Strawberry Delights Strawberry Cake Strawberry Cheesecake Cookies Save It Print Easy Fresh Strawberry Pie Prep Time 15 mins Cook Time 10 mins Chill Time 4 hrs Total Time 4 hrs 25 mins Servings 8 servings Yield 1 (9-inch) pie Cook Mode (Keep screen awake) Ingredients 1 (9-inch) graham cracker or deep dish pastry pie crust 2 pounds fresh strawberries , divided, plus a few extra for garnish 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup water 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice , optional 2 cups whipped cream (made from 1 cup of heavy whipping cream) or whipped topping Method Prepare the crust, if needed: If you’re using a store-bought graham cracker crust, then all you need to do is unwrap it. If you’re using a frozen or refrigerated pastry pie crust, bake according to the package directions and let cool before using. Prep the strawberries: Cap the strawberries and slice them in half; you should have 6 to 7 cups. If your strawberries are huge, you may want to quarter them. Add about 4 cups of them to a medium pot, and set the remaining strawberries aside. Mash the strawberries in the pot slightly with a potato masher or fork. Add the sugar to the pot and stir. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Cook the pie filling: Turn on the heat to medium and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Meanwhile, combine the water and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk together with a fork until fully combined. Once the strawberry mixture is boiling and the sugar has dissolved, add the cornstarch and water mixture while stirring. Stir continuously as the mixture comes up to a boil, then boil while stirring for 1 to 2 minutes and no more. The filling will thicken and turn from opaque to clear when it’s ready. Turn off the heat. Simple Tip! It's important to only boil the filling for a maximum of 2 minutes. As soon as a minute passes and the filling has thickened and turned clear, remove it from the heat. If you boil it for too long, it will not continue to thicken as it chills in the fridge and you'll end up with a soupy pie. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Fill the pie: Add the remaining strawberries to the pot along with the lemon juice, if using, and stir to coat all of the berries. Add the filling to the prepared crust and place it in the fridge to chill for at least 4 hours; 12 to 24 hours is even better. Simple Tip! Depending on the size of your pan and pie crust, you might end up with a little extra filling. Reserve the extra in a covered container and refrigerate, enjoying it later with vanilla ice cream or yogurt. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Serve: When ready to serve, pipe or mound whipped cream onto the center of the top of the pie and garnish with a few halved strawberries, or serve the whipped cream alongside for dolloping on each slice.

Homemade Strawberry Pie Filling / Topping Let's just say it like it is: there is never an excuse to buy a canned strawberry pie filling when it's so easy to make and keep on hand at home, especially, and most importantly, during peak strawberry season! This recipe is all about that fresh and vibrant strawberry flavor with a perfectly thickened fruity sauce. Like many of my other \"pie filling\" recipes, the intention of this Strawberry Pie Filling / Topping is to make a homemade version of the canned stuff available at grocery stores. We all know homemade is world's away better testing, and this recipe is here to show it's simple to make too! Premade strawberry pie filling is perfect for all kinds of desserts, such as strawberry crisp, cheesecakes, strawberry puff pastries, with yogurt, and even as a cake filling. It's also delicious all by itself, or with a scoop of ice cream. It freezes well too, so this recipe is one of the best ways to use up any large quantities of strawberries you might have when they are in season. So, let's get to making it, shall we? The text below offers tons of tips and helpful notes, or you can scroll to the bottom to grab the recipe and get started! Ingredients Needed Here is an overview of the ingredients needed for this recipe. The full recipe is listed below in greater detail. ripe fresh strawberries lemon juice granulated sugar quick-cooking tapioca (or cornstarch, see section labeled \"Best Thickener for Strawberry Pie Filling\" for more info on this) salt Let's Talk Strawberries Many of us have access to strawberries year round. Depending on your eating philiosphy, you might find this to be a good thing or a bad thing. What isn't up for debate is that out-of-season strawberries that have traveled a long distance from big agri-farms are vastly different than locally grown and harvested in-season berries. When it comes to in-season strawberries, local varieties tend to be smaller in size, but pack so much more flavor in. These little gems also have a much brighter vibrant red color throughout the fruit. The sweetness may vary depending on the local climate during the growing season. It's important to taste your strawberries before starting the recipe. If they are tart, a higher amount of sugar will be needed, while if they are sweet, less sugar will suffice. At the risk of pointing out the obvious, the quality of the strawberry used in this recipe will significantly impact the final outcome. Best Way to Clean Strawberries It is recommended to wash your strawberries, even if they appear to be clean. Sometimes, you may not be aware of the amount of dirt on the fruit until you clean them and notice the grit at the bottom of the bowl. The best way to wash them is to fill up a very big bowl full of cold water. Add a few big glugs of distilled white vinegar. The exact solution is supposed to be 1 parts vinegar to 3 parts water, but I usually eyeball it. The acidity in the vinegar helps break down the dirt and any possible pesticides on the surface of the fruit. It also has some mild antibacterial properties which can help prolong the life of the strawberry. Add the strawberries into the water/vinegar solution and give the strawberries a good swish around. Then let them sit for a few minutes, but no more than five. Don't pour the strawberries out, instead, pick the strawberries out with your hands from the water, working not to disturb any of the dirt / debris that has fallen off and sunk to the bottom of the bowl. Then transfer the strawberries to a strainer. Rinse them well, and then place them on a lint-free towel to dry off. Best Thickener for Strawberry Pie Filling I've made a lot of \"pie filling\" recipes on this website, but this strawberry one was perhaps the trickiest. And that's because strawberries are so juicy, so delicate, and their flavor can change when cooked for too long. When it comes to thickening juicy fillings, I prefer to use quick-cooking tapioca, which is also known as instant tapioca or minute tapioca. Tapioca is made from the cassava plant, and it's similar to tapioca pearls and tapioca starch, but it is processed into small granules that cook quickly. Quick cooking tapioca works by absorbing the juicy filling into the granules, which then creates a thick, clear filling. If you look closely in the filling you can see the very tiny beads of tapioca, but it is not something you will taste or notice unless you are looking for it. Using quick cooking tapioca is ideal as it thickens the strawberry juice to the right consistency without making the filling cloudy or too gummy. It allows the clean and bright strawberry flavor to shine through. Quick cooking tapioca (QCT) is available in all major grocery stores, usually in the baking aisle near the cornstarch. However, QCT isn't for everybody. So cornstarch can be a substitute if needed. The main recipe is based on using QCT, but it can be modified to use cornstarch instead by using the instructions in parenthesis in the spots where it is needed. Brief Recipe Overview This recipe is pretty simple to make, but I recommend reading it through a few times as the steps can move quickly, and all prep should be done before beginning. Here are is a brief overview of the recipe: Prep the strawberries and puree some of them with lemon juice and water Add that strawberry juice to a pot with sugar and the thickener and cook When the juice has thickened, add the sliced strawberries, and cook just until the juice comes back to a boil Immediately remove the strawberry filling from the pot and cool The strawberry filling is essentially cooked until it's the proper consistency and then the strawberry slices are added in and briefly cooked. If you are concerned they are not cooked enough after they come up to a boil, know that the residual heat will continue to cook the strawberries, which is why it's important to take them off the heat right away. Ways to Use Strawberry Pie Filling Okay, now you've got your strawberry pie filling. What should you use it for? in a no-bake pie in a crisp (use this crisp recipe or this pie crumble recipe for topping it) filling for a cake in a pastry (here is puff pastry dough or croissant dough ) in a galette (use this butter dough ) in pop tarts (use this pop tart dough ) hand pies (use this dough ) over waffles or pancakes with oatmeal with greek yogurt plain served with ice cream Thoughts on Turning this Into a Pie Since publishing this recipe, and some of my other fruit pie filling recipes, I've gotten the question: well how do I bake it as a pie? And the truth is, my intention when making this recipe wasn't, first and foremost to be baked as a pie. However, maybe you've found this recipe on google and you are actually looking to make a double crust fruit pie and are confused of why I don't have instructions to make this into a pie. That's because this is a recipe for cooked filling, as an alternative for canned strawberry pie filling that is store-bought. If I'm making a fruit pie, baking a raw fruit filling would be my number one choice in most instances, not using a precooked filling. This is because double-crust fruit pies need to be cooked for a long time to ensure a crisp bottom pastry, and raw fruit will hold up better with a long bake. So if you googled strawberry pie filling hoping to make a strawberry pie, I'll say you can check out this Strawberry Rhubarb Pie or Cherry Strawberry Pie . If you still prefer to make a strawberry pie out of this filling, I suggest you check out this detailed post about baking a double crust fruit pie . Or if you want the shortened instructions for making a strawberry pie with precooked filling I'll say: bake it at 425ºF on the lowest shelf for 50-60 minutes or until the crust is deep golden. The recipe must be doubled to get enough filling for a pie. How to Store Strawberry Pie Filling Mason jars are a great way to store the filling. This recipe makes approximately one full pint. Because it has a high water content, strawberry pie filling doesn't keep as long as other pie fillings. It's best used within 3-4 days after storing in the refrigerator. However, it freezes well and will last for about 3 months in the freezer. After three months, it will start to lose some of its potent flavor, but it's still technically safe to eat for up 12 months, though it's not ideal. I don't recommend canning this. Canning is so specific and I have not tested this to make sure it passes the amount of sugar and acidity needed to make it safe for canning. I'd recommend freezing it instead, for long term storage.

It's vibrant and bright and perfect for pies, desserts, or any other sweet treat that calls for strawberry pie filling or strawberry topping. The preferred thickener to use for this pie filling for the most vibrant flavor is quick-cooking tapioca. If you prefer to use cornstarch, there are alternative instructions for this within the recipe. Note the differences before beginning the recipe. Author: Kelli Avila Prep Time: 00:10 Cook Time: 00:10 Total Time: 20 minutes Yield: 1 pint Category: Pie Filling Method: Stovetop Ingredients 1 quart ( 16 ounces ) ripe strawberries, washed, hulled and sliced 1 tablespoon lemon juice ⅓ to ½ cup ( 70 - 100 grams) sugar (depends on how sweet the strawberries are) 1 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca or 1 tablespoon cornstarch (see notes) Pinch salt Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark Instructions Add ½ cup (3 ounces) of sliced strawberries to a blender with lemon juice and ½ cup water (omit the water if using cornstarch), and blend until completely smooth. Add the sugar to a pot with quick-cooking tapioca (or cornstarch), and salt and stir to combine. Pour in the juice and stir to combine. Heat over medium and let the juice come to a boil. Lower the heat to simmer and continue cooking to soften the tapioca pearls, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened. (If using cornstarch, do not simmer, instead once it thickens up from the boil, move on to the next step). Add in strawberries and cook, stirring frequently until it comes back to a simmer, then shut off the heat. Immediately transfer the filling to a wide container to cool quickly. When cool, pour into a jar. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use, about 3-4 days. Or in the freezer, for up to 3 months. Notes Have a question or looking for tips? The text written above the recipe is always a great first place to start! This Strawberry Pie Filling was developed with love,  and I always include loads of explanations, tips, step-by-step photos and technical advice shared before the recipe. This recipe makes about 1 pint of filling. To make enough for a full pie, the recipe needs to be doubled. Double all of the ingredients, but keep the amount of strawberries that are pureed to ½ cup. You can precook the filling for a no-bake pie, or add the filling into a pie without cooking, see the section \"Thoughts on Turning This into a Pie\" for more information. Did you make this recipe?

Final product is runny but not overly so, with a consistency closer to syrup. Best thing was how beautifully clear it was providing the pie with a beautiful finish. 03 of 24 Photo by Bobbie Taylor 12/23/2022 I loved this recipe! Turned out great! I did not use fresh strawberries, but frozen unsweetened ones. I ran out, and used 3/4 cup sweetened strawberry halves to add to the mashed mixture. I strained my sliced strawberries to get rid of the excess juice. I used the juice from the bag and from the mashed pulp. Didn\\'t have to add water. I\\'m incorporating the pulp in my sweetened strawberry container to use in my punch bowl cake. I used the filling for a Jell-O mold with sweetened condensed milk, crushed pineapple, strawberry jello, cool whip, and pecans. The fresher filling brought the mold to another level! Thank you for this recipe! Will definitely be making this again! 04 of 24 Photo by ClassyDish6990 11/24/2022 Thank you fotoe!78, this recipe came out better than expected! An interesting thing to add about the filling is that you can control the color of the finished product by adjusting the heat, which is pretty cool. 05 of 24 Photo by Heather 06/29/2021 06 of 24 Photo by kitkatkf 12/20/2020 Delicious.

Recipes Desserts Desserts By Ingredients Strawberry Desserts Easy Fresh Strawberry Pie You just need 5 ingredients and 30 minutes to make it. By Laurel Randolph Laurel Randolph Laurel has over 10 years of experience developing recipes and writing about food. She is the author of 4 cookbooks, including the bestselling \"The Instant Pot Electric Cookbook.\" Learn about Simply Recipes\\' Editorial Process Updated February 17, 2025 5 Ratings Print Close Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Jump to recipe My whole life, I’ve never had my fill of strawberries . When berry season rolls around, all I want is perfectly ripe, sweet strawberries day and night. As a kid, my mom would have to cut me off, knowing I’d eat the freshly picked berries from the farm down the road until my stomach ached. And my cravings don’t stop at plain berries, either—strawberry desserts, like strawberry cake and strawberry pie are equally welcome. Fresh strawberry pie frequently appeared on our dining room table during the summer. My mom made an easy version using strawberry gelatin, loaded with big pieces of berries and topped with Cool Whip. It required minimal baking and was served nice and chilled, perfect for summer. I set out to make my own Jell-O-free version that’s as simple as possible. The result is a fresh strawberry pie that requires zero baking and is bursting with strawberry flavor. Instead of gelatin, a simple cornstarch mixture, along with the berries themselves, thickens the filling. A pastry crust is more traditional, but I prefer a crispy cookie crust here. Piled high with whipped cream, it’s a summertime dream. Timing Is Everything While this recipe couldn\\'t be simpler, the timing is key. After adding the cornstarch mixture, the filling needs to be boiled just enough to thicken and turn the mixture clear, then no more. Over-boiling will actually cause the pie filling to lose its thick texture after chilling. Boil the filling just until it turns clear and thickens, as little as 1 minute and no more than 2 minutes. Then be sure to chill the pie for a minimum of four hours—I recommend overnight or longer. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Tips for Make It Ahead This pie will set up the best if you chill it overnight, making it ideal for making ahead. Make the pie (sans whipped cream) up to two days before serving. If you have any smelly things in your fridge, you’ll want to cover the pie tightly with plastic wrap. Add the fresh whipped cream and fresh strawberry garnish just before serving.

If you’re using a frozen or refrigerated pastry pie crust, bake according to the package directions and let cool before using. Prep the strawberries: Cap the strawberries and slice them in half; you should have 6 to 7 cups. If your strawberries are huge, you may want to quarter them. Add about 4 cups of them to a medium pot, and set the remaining strawberries aside. Mash the strawberries in the pot slightly with a potato masher or fork. Add the sugar to the pot and stir. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Cook the pie filling: Turn on the heat to medium and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Meanwhile, combine the water and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk together with a fork until fully combined. Once the strawberry mixture is boiling and the sugar has dissolved, add the cornstarch and water mixture while stirring. Stir continuously as the mixture comes up to a boil, then boil while stirring for 1 to 2 minutes and no more. The filling will thicken and turn from opaque to clear when it’s ready. Turn off the heat. Simple Tip! It\\'s important to only boil the filling for a maximum of 2 minutes. As soon as a minute passes and the filling has thickened and turned clear, remove it from the heat. If you boil it for too long, it will not continue to thicken as it chills in the fridge and you\\'ll end up with a soupy pie. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Fill the pie: Add the remaining strawberries to the pot along with the lemon juice, if using, and stir to coat all of the berries. Add the filling to the prepared crust and place it in the fridge to chill for at least 4 hours; 12 to 24 hours is even better. Simple Tip! Depending on the size of your pan and pie crust, you might end up with a little extra filling. Reserve the extra in a covered container and refrigerate, enjoying it later with vanilla ice cream or yogurt. Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm Serve: When ready to serve, pipe or mound whipped cream onto the center of the top of the pie and garnish with a few halved strawberries, or serve the whipped cream alongside for dolloping on each slice.

Homemade Strawberry Pie Filling / Topping Let\\'s just say it like it is: there is never an excuse to buy a canned strawberry pie filling when it\\'s so easy to make and keep on hand at home, especially, and most importantly, during peak strawberry season! This recipe is all about that fresh and vibrant strawberry flavor with a perfectly thickened fruity sauce. Like many of my other \"pie filling\" recipes, the intention of this Strawberry Pie Filling / Topping is to make a homemade version of the canned stuff available at grocery stores. We all know homemade is world\\'s away better testing, and this recipe is here to show it\\'s simple to make too! Premade strawberry pie filling is perfect for all kinds of desserts, such as strawberry crisp, cheesecakes, strawberry puff pastries, with yogurt, and even as a cake filling. It\\'s also delicious all by itself, or with a scoop of ice cream. It freezes well too, so this recipe is one of the best ways to use up any large quantities of strawberries you might have when they are in season. So, let\\'s get to making it, shall we? The text below offers tons of tips and helpful notes, or you can scroll to the bottom to grab the recipe and get started! Ingredients Needed Here is an overview of the ingredients needed for this recipe. The full recipe is listed below in greater detail. ripe fresh strawberries lemon juice granulated sugar quick-cooking tapioca (or cornstarch, see section labeled \"Best Thickener for Strawberry Pie Filling\" for more info on this) salt Let\\'s Talk Strawberries Many of us have access to strawberries year round. Depending on your eating philiosphy, you might find this to be a good thing or a bad thing. What isn\\'t up for debate is that out-of-season strawberries that have traveled a long distance from big agri-farms are vastly different than locally grown and harvested in-season berries. When it comes to in-season strawberries, local varieties tend to be smaller in size, but pack so much more flavor in. These little gems also have a much brighter vibrant red color throughout the fruit. The sweetness may vary depending on the local climate during the growing season. It\\'s important to taste your strawberries before starting the recipe. If they are tart, a higher amount of sugar will be needed, while if they are sweet, less sugar will suffice. At the risk of pointing out the obvious, the quality of the strawberry used in this recipe will significantly impact the final outcome. Best Way to Clean Strawberries It is recommended to wash your strawberries, even if they appear to be clean. Sometimes, you may not be aware of the amount of dirt on the fruit until you clean them and notice the grit at the bottom of the bowl. The best way to wash them is to fill up a very big bowl full of cold water. Add a few big glugs of distilled white vinegar. The exact solution is supposed to be 1 parts vinegar to 3 parts water, but I usually eyeball it. The acidity in the vinegar helps break down the dirt and any possible pesticides on the surface of the fruit. It also has some mild antibacterial properties which can help prolong the life of the strawberry. Add the strawberries into the water/vinegar solution and give the strawberries a good swish around. Then let them sit for a few minutes, but no more than five. Don\\'t pour the strawberries out, instead, pick the strawberries out with your hands from the water, working not to disturb any of the dirt / debris that has fallen off and sunk to the bottom of the bowl. Then transfer the strawberries to a strainer. Rinse them well, and then place them on a lint-free towel to dry off. Best Thickener for Strawberry Pie Filling I\\'ve made a lot of \"pie filling\" recipes on this website, but this strawberry one was perhaps the trickiest. And that\\'s because strawberries are so juicy, so delicate, and their flavor can change when cooked for too long. When it comes to thickening juicy fillings, I prefer to use quick-cooking tapioca, which is also known as instant tapioca or minute tapioca. Tapioca is made from the cassava plant, and it\\'s similar to tapioca pearls and tapioca starch, but it is processed into small granules that cook quickly. Quick cooking tapioca works by absorbing the juicy filling into the granules, which then creates a thick, clear filling. If you look closely in the filling you can see the very tiny beads of tapioca, but it is not something you will taste or notice unless you are looking for it. Using quick cooking tapioca is ideal as it thickens the strawberry juice to the right consistency without making the filling cloudy or too gummy. It allows the clean and bright strawberry flavor to shine through. Quick cooking tapioca (QCT) is available in all major grocery stores, usually in the baking aisle near the cornstarch. However, QCT isn\\'t for everybody. So cornstarch can be a substitute if needed. The main recipe is based on using QCT, but it can be modified to use cornstarch instead by using the instructions in parenthesis in the spots where it is needed. Brief Recipe Overview This recipe is pretty simple to make, but I recommend reading it through a few times as the steps can move quickly, and all prep should be done before beginning. Here are is a brief overview of the recipe: Prep the strawberries and puree some of them with lemon juice and water Add that strawberry juice to a pot with sugar and the thickener and cook When the juice has thickened, add the sliced strawberries, and cook just until the juice comes back to a boil Immediately remove the strawberry filling from the pot and cool The strawberry filling is essentially cooked until it\\'s the proper consistency and then the strawberry slices are added in and briefly cooked. If you are concerned they are not cooked enough after they come up to a boil, know that the residual heat will continue to cook the strawberries, which is why it\\'s important to take them off the heat right away. Ways to Use Strawberry Pie Filling Okay, now you\\'ve got your strawberry pie filling. What should you use it for? in a no-bake pie in a crisp (use this crisp recipe or this pie crumble recipe for topping it) filling for a cake in a pastry (here is puff pastry dough or croissant dough ) in a galette (use this butter dough ) in pop tarts (use this pop tart dough ) hand pies (use this dough ) over waffles or pancakes with oatmeal with greek yogurt plain served with ice cream Thoughts on Turning this Into a Pie Since publishing this recipe, and some of my other fruit pie filling recipes, I\\'ve gotten the question: well how do I bake it as a pie? And the truth is, my intention when making this recipe wasn\\'t, first and foremost to be baked as a pie. However, maybe you\\'ve found this recipe on google and you are actually looking to make a double crust fruit pie and are confused of why I don\\'t have instructions to make this into a pie. That\\'s because this is a recipe for cooked filling, as an alternative for canned strawberry pie filling that is store-bought. If I\\'m making a fruit pie, baking a raw fruit filling would be my number one choice in most instances, not using a precooked filling. This is because double-crust fruit pies need to be cooked for a long time to ensure a crisp bottom pastry, and raw fruit will hold up better with a long bake. So if you googled strawberry pie filling hoping to make a strawberry pie, I\\'ll say you can check out this Strawberry Rhubarb Pie or Cherry Strawberry Pie . If you still prefer to make a strawberry pie out of this filling, I suggest you check out this detailed post about baking a double crust fruit pie . Or if you want the shortened instructions for making a strawberry pie with precooked filling I\\'ll say: bake it at 425ºF on the lowest shelf for 50-60 minutes or until the crust is deep golden. The recipe must be doubled to get enough filling for a pie. How to Store Strawberry Pie Filling Mason jars are a great way to store the filling. This recipe makes approximately one full pint. Because it has a high water content, strawberry pie filling doesn\\'t keep as long as other pie fillings. It\\'s best used within 3-4 days after storing in the refrigerator. However, it freezes well and will last for about 3 months in the freezer. After three months, it will start to lose some of its potent flavor, but it\\'s still technically safe to eat for up 12 months, though it\\'s not ideal. I don\\'t recommend canning this. Canning is so specific and I have not tested this to make sure it passes the amount of sugar and acidity needed to make it safe for canning. I\\'d recommend freezing it instead, for long term storage.

It\\'s vibrant and bright and perfect for pies, desserts, or any other sweet treat that calls for strawberry pie filling or strawberry topping. The preferred thickener to use for this pie filling for the most vibrant flavor is quick-cooking tapioca. If you prefer to use cornstarch, there are alternative instructions for this within the recipe. Note the differences before beginning the recipe. Author: Kelli Avila Prep Time: 00:10 Cook Time: 00:10 Total Time: 20 minutes Yield: 1 pint Category: Pie Filling Method: Stovetop Ingredients 1 quart ( 16 ounces ) ripe strawberries, washed, hulled and sliced 1 tablespoon lemon juice ⅓ to ½ cup ( 70 - 100 grams) sugar (depends on how sweet the strawberries are) 1 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca or 1 tablespoon cornstarch (see notes) Pinch salt Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark Instructions Add ½ cup (3 ounces) of sliced strawberries to a blender with lemon juice and ½ cup water (omit the water if using cornstarch), and blend until completely smooth. Add the sugar to a pot with quick-cooking tapioca (or cornstarch), and salt and stir to combine. Pour in the juice and stir to combine. Heat over medium and let the juice come to a boil. Lower the heat to simmer and continue cooking to soften the tapioca pearls, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes until the sauce is thickened. (If using cornstarch, do not simmer, instead once it thickens up from the boil, move on to the next step). Add in strawberries and cook, stirring frequently until it comes back to a simmer, then shut off the heat. Immediately transfer the filling to a wide container to cool quickly. When cool, pour into a jar. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use, about 3-4 days. Or in the freezer, for up to 3 months. Notes Have a question or looking for tips? The text written above the recipe is always a great first place to start! This Strawberry Pie Filling was developed with love,\\xa0 and I always include loads of explanations, tips, step-by-step photos and technical advice shared before the recipe. This recipe makes about 1 pint of filling. To make enough for a full pie, the recipe needs to be doubled. Double all of the ingredients, but keep the amount of strawberries that are pureed to ½ cup. You can precook the filling for a no-bake pie, or add the filling into a pie without cooking, see the section \"Thoughts on Turning This into a Pie\" for more information. Did you make this recipe?

He co-founded a bookshop, the Collectors Treasury, in 1974 with his brother Jonathan, which became an institution for the city’s bibliophiles. Klass was born in 1948 to psychiatrist father Dr Max Klass and Maisie (née Goldberg) in Johannesburg. His grandparents Solomon and Zelda Klass were immigrants to South Africa from Lithuania and they sold everything from ginger beer to baby clothes. Solomon bought property and acquired the Johannesburg Ritz Hotel and later owned a residential hotel in Berea, and for a time he was the owner of the Radium Beer Hall. Klass attributed his love of books and collecting to his father. Books were part of the family home in Doveton Road in Parktown West, while Maisie was an avid antiques collector. “We inherited a well-rounded view of cultural matters, and we were instilled with a love of objects and the history behind them. We don’t specialise, we don’t see boundaries, we see everything in a broad stream of culture,” Klass said in a 2005 interview with the Heritage Portal. He matriculated at Parktown Boys High and went on to read for a Bachelor of Science degree at Wits, graduating in 1972. His interests were broad and “the academic trajectory was too narrow for his exploding mind.” He declined the opportunity to study on a fellowship, for a PhD in Chicago. In 1991 the Klass family bought a building at 244 Commissioner Street in old Johannesburg and part of the revitalised Maboneng to house their massive collection. It was an old face-bricked, eight-storey building which originally was an old clothing factory. In addition to books, the stock extended to antique maps, old engravings and prints, printed ephemera, periodicals, newspapers and photographs. They also curated and dealt in vinyl records and 78rpm discs. The shop housed an extensive range of small antiques and collectables, with a strong emphasis on the decorative arts between 1870-1970, glassware, ceramics and porcelain. Klass was the founding member and first chairman of the South African Bookdealers Association, the official body for out-of-print bookdealers in Southern Africa. He is survived by his brother Jonathan and sister-in-law Jenny, niece and nephew Mathew and Rebecca, and by his beloved partner, Gundi Weinick. Source: Kathy Munro, Heritage Portal Andrew Dickson (1940-2025) Former head of school in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Wits Professor Andrew John Dickson (BSc Eng 1962, MSc Eng 1964) died peacefully at the age of 84 in his home in Colorado, US. Dickson matriculated from St John’s College and he was awarded with both a graduate and master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Wits. He received a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology soon after and completed another master’s in electrical engineering. On returning to South Africa, he worked as an engineer in Mokopane for several years before returning to Wits as lecturer in Engineering Design in the School of Mechanical Engineering. Teaching was his first love. He was well-liked and respected by his students and fellow academics. He always had time to help his students and never turned anyone away from his door. In the early 1980s Eskom lured him back into the profession. He went on to have an illustrious career in Eskom and was, for many years, generation engineering manager. He played a major role in the team which included John Maree (BCom 1949) and Ian McRae (BSc Eng 1954, DSc Eng honoris causa 1989), who built Eskom into being one of the finest generation companies in the world at the time. In the mid-1990s he returned to Wits to take up the Eskom Chair of Engineering in the Faculty. He remained in that role until his retirement. Soon after retiring, he and his wife Pam (BSc 1962) moved to Colorado to be closer to their daughter Susan van den Heever (BSc 1989, PDipEd 1989, BSc Hons 1991, MSc 1995), who is a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. Source: Dickson family Christopher Julian Cooke (1940-2025) Emeritus Professor in the School of Architecture, Planning and Geomatics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), Christopher Julian Cooke (BArch 1963, HDipTP 1972) died on 24 February 2025. Cooke, known affectionately as Julian, started teaching at UCT in 1976 and retired formally in 2000, serving as the dean in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, as well as director of the school. He played a pivotal role in forging various programmes, as well as creating a curriculum that questioned the status quo, was politically progressive and anti-apartheid. Student projects in both planning and architecture were regularly set in the urban and rural conditions of the apartheid city of Cape Town, and small towns nearby. Architecture was understood to not only be a formal artistic or sculptural endeavour, but also a socio-political one. He was editor of the journal Architecture SA from 1982 to 1987, and was re-appointed in 2003. He won several open architectural competitions in South Africa, and received many awards, including the South African Institute of Architects Gold Medal Award for architecture in 2015. Cooke’s most significant work was the hostels upgrade programme which comprised approximately 3000 units in Nyanga, Gugulethu and Langa. He said the squalid, barrack-like hostels reminded him of Charles Dickens’ “dark, satanic mills” of the European industrial revolution 150 years ago. The transformation took 15 years to accomplish, with Cooke establishing a relationship with the community he later he regarded as family. He described moments of beauty he encountered: “The difference between the living conditions and the way places are occupied says something profound about the greatness and resourcefulness of human beings. In one room we meet a woman who is carefully braiding her daughter’s hair. The child is sitting on a bed covered with an immaculately embroidered bedspread and on the wall next to her is a large, framed picture of a curly-haired Jesus. I find the irony in the juxtaposition of such care and beauty with the crude hostel block difficult to bear.” The project won the firm, Architects Associated, of which Cooke was part, the Impumelelo Innovations Award in 2004.His lectures were described as interesting and accessible. He came up with the idea of a project called “Ten dreams for Cape Town”. This was a project that brought together many architects and urban designers, to rethink and, importantly, to show, an alternative Cape Town that was more efficient, egalitarian and sustainable. This project culminated in a series of lectures for one of UCT’s Summer School courses in 2019, with an accompanying exhibition. It was later turned into a book titled A Vision for a Future Cape Town. He had an unwavering belief in the project of architecture and continued to teach long after retirement from the school as well as creating courses for UCT’s Summer School. He will be remembered as an “exemplary architect, urban designer, teacher and human being.” Sources: UCT and Artefacts Senamile Masango (1987-2025) One of South Africa’s trailblazing black female nuclear scientists, Senamile Masango (PDM 2021) died aged 37, from an unknown cause, on 8 February 2025. Dubbed “the queen of science”by some, Masango was born in KwaNongoma, in KwaZulu-Natal. She demonstrated a passion for learning and her family encouraged her to read extensively from an early age. She enrolled at the University of KwaZulu-Natal atthe age of 16 to pursue a Bachelor of Science in physics and electronics, followed by an honours degree in nuclear physics from the University of the Western Cape, where she conducted research on the B(E2) value in Neon-20. She completed a postgraduate diploma in energy leadership from Wits Business School. In 2017 Masango was part of the first African-led experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), one of the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. Her many accomplishments include being South Africa’s research leader at the BRICS Youth Energy Outlook in 2019, where her foundation led the winning team in 2020. Recognised among the 50 Global Inspirational Women of 2020 and a Women in Tech Global Awards finalist in 2021 and 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community. She was the executive chairperson and founder of Mphathisithele Consulting PTY, and dedicated her career to empowering African women in STEM and advancing sustainable development goals. At the time of her death, she was completing her doctoral studies in nuclear physics and was the founder of Women in Science and Engineering (Wise). Through Wise, Masango provided leadership and role models for young women wishing to enter the fields of science and engineering. Proceeds made from her speaking engagements went towards raising money to provide science kits for disadvantaged schools. But throughout her career, Masango faced the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender. “The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think! There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,” she said. Sources: BBC and NECSA Mehnaaz Ally (1980-2025) Dr Mehnaaz Ally (MBBCh 2005) a dedicated paediatric palliative care practitioner, died on 6 February 2025. She was found unresponsive in her home after experiencing a massive internal brain haemorrhage. A touching “walk of honour”was held for Ally as an organ donor, as she arrived at Milpark Hospital on the morning after her death. A large crowd of people turned up to show their respects as she was wheeled through the ward. The request had been sent out to “wear bright colours” as homage to her positive and colourful personality. After completing her undergraduate degree in medicine from Wits in 2005, she pursued postgraduate studies in paediatrics, and then in paediatric palliative care. She successfully completed the post-graduate diploma in paediatric palliative medicine through the University of Cape Town in 2017, with distinction. She worked at various palliative care NGOs, including WitsPal (Wits Palliative Care at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital), the Lambano Sanctuary, a paediatric step-down unit and hospice faculty in Germiston, the Rare Diseases South Africa as well as PatchSA. According to her colleagues, her empathetic approach to care extended beyond clinical practice, she understood the importance of listening and advocacy. She was passionate about educating fellow healthcare workers about paediatric pain and had a special interest in neonatal pain and palliation. She also ran support groups and debriefing workshops for healthcare workers burdened by burnout and compassion fatigue. Sources: Rare Diseases South Africa , Lambano Sanctuary and PatchSA Harold Luntz (1937-2025) Harold Luntz (BA 1957, LLB 1959), who was Emeritus Professor at Melbourne Law School, died at the age of 87 on 29 January 2025. He was one of the world’s foremost scholars and theoreticians of torts and damages law. A much-loved colleague and lecturer, he authored numerous articles, incisive case notes, engaging book reviews, comments on the direction of the law and other publications. Luntz was born in Johannesburg, matriculating from Athlone Boys High School. After completing a Bachelor of Arts at Wits, he studied towards his LLB, serving articles of clerkship at the same time as undertaking the degree; both took three years. In 1960, he was employed for a brief period as a solicitor in a firm of solicitors in Johannesburg and then took a Bachelor of Civil Law at Lincoln College at the University of Oxford. He began publishing in academic journals in the early 1960s. He emigrated to Australia in 1965, joining the Faculty of Law as a senior lecturer. He excelled as a writer and teacher. In 1970, he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1976 was appointed George Paton Professor of Law, a position he held until his retirement in 2002. He also served as a successful Dean at the Melbourne University Law School from 1986 to 1988. Following his retirement, he continued to teach in the postgraduate programme until 2008. Luntz took time off in 1970 to pursue his interests in comparative law as visiting associate professor at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada. Later, in 1971, he was visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. But his commitment was to Melbourne and Australia. He returned as Reader in Law in July 1971. His professorial chair came in July 1976, and he served as dean over three years from 1986–88. He was twice a visiting fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford, where he was attached on each occasion to the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Melbourne in 1983. In 2000 he was the inaugural recipient of the John G Fleming Memorial Award for Torts Scholarship, and in 2003 he was awarded the AILA Insurance Law Prize. From 2007, the Harold Luntz Graduate Research Thesis Prize commemorating Luntz’s achievements as a “world expert on torts law” has been awarded annually to the Melbourne Law School graduate research student judged to have presented the best thesis in the previous year, provided that the nominee meets an overall level of excellence required for the award. The prize specifically honours Luntz’s contribution on the international stage and as a former dean. Luntz was made an Officer in the general division in the Order of Australia in the Australia Day 2019 Honours List “for distinguished service to legal education, as an academic and editor, to professional development and to the community”. After Luntz’s retirement, Justice Michael Kirby wrote a tribute in the Melbourne University Law Review in 2003 titled Harold Luntz: Doyen of the Australian Law of Torts , saying Luntz was a lawyer who, unusually, “listened before he spoke”, a man with a reputation for “reading everything”; loved by his students “because he was a good storyteller”; and throughout his long, illustrious career displayed three great strengths: commonsense, practical wisdom and plain speaking. Justice Kirby noted that Luntz’s childhood and experiences in South Africa shaped his outlook on justice profoundly: “His childhood and youth in that country had a profound effect upon his view of the world and of the law. South Africa was never a lawless state. That, indeed, was the central problem. It embalmed in law rules that anyone with sensitivity (and particularly anyone who was from a minority) could see were offensive to human equality, to personal autonomy and to the effective operation of law as an instrument of justice. I venture to suggest that those early years left a mark on Harold Luntz that has stayed with him ever since. They help to explain his sense of urgency, his great energy, his pursuit of justice through law and his search for a better home to give voice to these ideals.” Sources: The University of Melbourne, Wikipedia, Melbourne University Law Review In Memoriam 2024 Chabani Manganyi (1960-2024) Distinguished academic, scholar, intellectual activist, psychologist, and public servant Professor Noel Chabani Manganyi died on 31 October 2024. He was born in the district of Louis Trichardt and after his schooling, studied at the University of South Africa where he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962, received an honours degree in psychology in 1964, a master’s in 1968 and a doctorate in 1970 with a thesis titled Body Image in Paraplegia . As part of his doctoral requirements, he held an internship in clinical psychology at Baragwanath Hospital and was appointed as a clinical psychologist, a post he occupied for three years until he left to take up a post-doctoral fellowship at Yale from 1973 until 1975. Manganyi published a series of monographs – the first was Being Black in the World (Ravan 1973, WUP 2019), the last Looking Through the Keyhole (Ravan Press 1981). In these works, he examined the effects of institutionalised racism on the internal worlds and external realities of South Africans – including alienation, distorted relations with the body and quest for freedom. He was one of the few who, before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, took the psychological effects of racism on society seriously. Manganyi examined the effects of violence on individuals and groups in Mashangu’s Reverie (Ravan 1977), which explores the place of the Black Consciousness Movement as the antithesis of the dominant and racist culture – and is seminal in the field of psychology. The exploration of the phenomenon of violence is reprised and elaborated in his later publications. In 1976 he took up a professorship at the University of Transkei, where he established the Department of Psychology and served as its first chair. In 1980 he was appointed senior research fellow and visiting professor at Wits’ African Studies Institute. This was his home for 10 years and the place where he produced ideas that laid the foundation for his subsequent research. He continued his clinical practice part-time and spent 1985 back at Yale as a visiting fellow. In 1990, he became Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of the North. When a fully democratic government was established in 1994, Manganyi stepped into the office of director general in the Department of Education, a position he held until 1999, when he became advisor to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Pretoria (UP). In 2003, he was appointed Vice-Principal of UP, an office he held until March 2006. He served on the board of Wits University Press. The concept of identity creation and retrieval, the theme of Mashangu’s Reverie , in part led to the second phase of Manganyi’s literary production, which involved history and biography. He suggested that biography is the “stock-in-trade of a clinical psychologist” in the “study and reconstruction of lives both in health and disease”. The first life he chose to study was one of South Africa’s best-known authors in Exiles and Homecomings: A Biography of Es’kia Mphahlele (Ravan Press 1983). Later he studied the life of painter Gerard Sekoto, publishing A Black Man Called Sekoto (Ravan Press 1996), which was a finalist in the Sunday Times Alan Paton Award and Gerard Sekoto: I am an African (2006). This was followed by the volume edited with David Attwell, Bury Me at the Marketplace: Es’kia Mphahlele and Company. Letters 1943-2006 (WUP 2009), his memoir Apartheid and the Making of a Black Psychologist (WUP 2016) won the Academy of Science of South Africa’s Humanities Book Award. In 2024 his contribution was recognised by the Caribbean Philosophical Association when he was named a recipient of the Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award. When he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Wits in 2008, the citation read: “In the best Wits intellectual tradition Prof Manganyi has achieved enormous output, while remaining unassuming.” Sources: Wits archive and The Conversation John Simon (1938-2024) Respected actuary and loyal Wits supporter John Simon (BSc 1959) died peacefully from dementia and frailty at the age 86 on 31 October 2024. He was the son of Pearl and Herbert Simon, born on Crown Mines near Johannesburg in 1938.He grew up on mines along the Reef, later Benoni and finally in Westcliff, near the Johannesburg Zoo along with his younger brother Lyddon (BA Hons 1956, LLB 1958). Simon matriculated from King Edward VII School, which provided him with many stories of friends such as Michael Feldman and Michael Whippman (BSc Hons 1960) and enough education to study mathematics through a scholarship at Wits. He met Eddie Price (BSc 1960) and Martin Bloom (BCom 1961) at university, who became life-long friends. Although he was not the most effusive or extroverted man, he made a few lifelong friendships. He was awarded the William Cullen Medal as joint top graduate in mathematics in his final year and won the Rotary Scholarship to pursue a PhD in statistics at Princeton University. After a year, he decided that academia was not for him and went to London to study to become an actuary. While in London, in 1962, he met Sally Caplan, whom he married two years later and they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary in the summer of 2024. He began his actuarial studies while working at the Sun Life of Canada offices in Cheapside in the city. At that time the notoriously difficult actuarial training was undertaken through part-time studies while working full time. He was allowed Friday afternoons off for studying and worked tirelessly each evening and most weekends, never failing an exam, but it still took four years passing one or two subjects each year. He sat his final qualifying exams six weeks after the birth of his first child, Daniel. After Sun Life, he joined Bacon and Woodrow, a firm he stayed with until his retirement, save for a six-month sojourn at Rothschilds. He was highly respected in his field and much valued as a colleague. A few colleagues shared the following tributes about him after news of his death: “He was responsible for some of the firm’s largest clients, and had great client handling skills. He was also very good at developing staff”; “You could sum him up in three words: ability, amiability, approachability” and “the most gentle gentleman I knew”. He served his profession more widely, becoming Master of the Worshipful Company of Actuaries in 1994/5, “not bad for a boy from Benoni” he would say when invited to the Queen’s Garden Party. He lived with honesty and gave quietly to charities that mattered to him. He did most things quietly. Quietly spoken and a man of few words, his dementia made him progressively quieter and frail, but he never complained. “Where is it written it should be easy?” he had frequently said of life. His wife Sally, and three children – Daniel, a lawyer and senior partner at Collyer Bristow, London; Gideon, a senior consulting software engineer at Sagentia, Cambridge; Jessica, a palliative care specialist in Calgary, Canada, and eight grandchildren survive him. Source: Simon family Neville Melville (1937-2024) Beloved teacher and education administrator Neville Melville (BA 1962, BA Hons 1988) died in Johannesburg on 29 September 2024 at the age of 86. On the news of his death, the family received messages from past students describing how they were inspired by him and how their lives were changed by his vision to uplift disadvantaged communities. Melville, who graduated from Wits in 1962 , was also a keen sportsman, representing the university in tennis and cross country. He taught mathematics and geography at various South African schools. In 1975 he was appointed vice-principal at Mondeor High School in Johannesburg, and in 1979 became principal at Lyttleton Manor High School. Between 1993 and 1997, Melville served as a superintendent for the Department of Education in the West Rand. With the advent of democracy in South Africa, he was appointed as a member of a two-man commission to evaluate four education departments and to formulate a strategy to establish one, multiracial department with a suitable examination system. He was also appointed to a board of commissioners to evaluate the credibility of the matriculation examination. In 1998, Melville registered a non-profit trust called the Edumap Education Development Trust, which was aimed at upgrading mathematics and physical science by providing academic enrichment courses to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It continues to do excellent work based on a transition model from secondary school level to tertiary level. This has ensured a 99% success rate at tertiary for the students who have attended the Edumap College . Melville served as a trustee and chairman of the South Deep Education Trust and the South Deep Community Trust between 2014 and 2023. He was a devoted family man who will be remembered for his work ethic, tenacity and generosity. He is survived by his wife Glenys, daughters Karen (BSc 1988, HDipEd 1989, BSc Hon 1990, MSc 2003, PhD 2013), Vanessa (BNurs 1993) and four grandchildren.

The Zimbabwean-born executive had an electrical engineering degree from the University of Zimbabwe and an MBA from Wits Business School. As a youngster, he confessed to having no career aspirations, other than “to be an engineer”. When he completed his engineering degree, he did a few years as a trainee on British Rail. After that, he went to work on Zimbabwe Railways, before joining a consulting engineering firm based in Pretoria, where he worked on projects in Botswana, Swaziland and the former Bophuthatswana. He told WBS Journal that doing his MBA full-time changed his life: “In the sense that it was unique, because it created new opportunities for changing my career.” He said Nick Binedell, then director of WBS influenced him most. He joined Eskom on completing his MBA and left the parastatal as executive director of distribution to join MTN in 1999 as managing director of South African operations. Dabengwa was instrumental in guiding MTN through significant phases of growth and transformation across Africa between 2011 and 2015 as CEO. He was appointed to the Eskom board in January 2018, just before the country’s delegation went to the World Economic Forum in Davos to assure investors that it was cleaning up state-owned entities. He resigned from the position in 2020. MTN president and CEO Ralph Mupita said Dabengwa’s impact was significant. “Sifiso was respected not only for his professional achievements, but also [the] integrity, humility and the respect he showed to all who worked with him. He was a mentor to many and a leader who exemplified the values of commitment and service.” He was fiercely private and found talking about himself uncomfortable and being photographed disconcerting. He referred to himself as “one” rather than “me” and spoke very softly. He is survived by his wife, Naspers SA CEO Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa and four children.

He was a recognised healthcare services professional, with decades of experience in insurance, customer service, employee benefits design, strategic planning, and business process improvement. In 2003, he founded Colin Plotkin & Sons Consulting, which later became Plotkin Health. Ian Cameron, Editor-in-Chief of The International Travel & Health Insurance Journal said: “Colin and I often had lively exchanges of opinion during our interactions at conferences, and I had great respect for his passion for the industry. He held strong views on the international healthcare sector, and was never afraid to air those views. While he had been retired for some time, he will nonetheless be missed within the community.” Dr Plotkin is survived by his wife Chery, Shaun, Darren, Ricci, Glen and 13 grandchildren. Source: International Travel & Health Insurance Journal Ian Froman (1937-2024) Founding father of Israeli tennis, Dr Ian Froman (BDS 1961) died at the age of 87 on 8 September 2024. Dr Froman served as chairman and president of the Israel Tennis Association and chairman of the Israel Tennis Centres for many years. He received the Israel Prize for his work in the field of sports and body culture in 1989 and was also awarded the International Jewish Spots Hall of Fame Pillar of Achievement Award. He was born in South Africa, the son of parents who were two of the founders of King David Linksfield, with his mother being the first headmistress. His love affair with tennis started at the age of four, and he played during his time at King Edward VII School. He reached the third round of the Wimbledon Championships in 1955 as an 18-year-old and was exposed to the likes of Jimmy Connors, Ilie Năstase, and Billie Jean King. Shortly after graduating from Wits, he made the squad for the South African Davis Cup team and was chosen for the Maccabi Games in 1961. In 1964 he immigrated to Israel with his wife and played for Israel in Davis Cup and later captained the team. In 1974 he left dentistry to devote himself full time to the sport saying: “Tennis is an educational sport because whether you are playing competitively or socially, you meet people from all backgrounds irrespective of their finances or religion.” He embarked on a huge project to fund the Israel Tennis Centre’s organisation that changed the face of the sport. It served as a breeding ground for the country’s top players. Dr Froman is survived by his wife Ruth, children Yarona, Amira, Philip and their families.

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

He co-founded a bookshop, the Collectors Treasury, in 1974 with his brother Jonathan, which became an institution for the city’s bibliophiles. Klass was born in 1948 to psychiatrist father Dr Max Klass and Maisie (née Goldberg) in Johannesburg. His grandparents Solomon and Zelda Klass were immigrants to South Africa from Lithuania and they sold everything from ginger beer to baby clothes. Solomon bought property and acquired the Johannesburg Ritz Hotel and later owned a residential hotel in Berea, and for a time he was the owner of the Radium Beer Hall. Klass attributed his love of books and collecting to his father. Books were part of the family home in Doveton Road in Parktown West, while Maisie was an avid antiques collector. “We inherited a well-rounded view of cultural matters, and we were instilled with a love of objects and the history behind them. We don’t specialise, we don’t see boundaries, we see everything in a broad stream of culture,” Klass said in a 2005 interview with the Heritage Portal. He matriculated at Parktown Boys High and went on to read for a Bachelor of Science degree at Wits, graduating in 1972. His interests were broad and “the academic trajectory was too narrow for his exploding mind.” He declined the opportunity to study on a fellowship, for a PhD in Chicago. In 1991 the Klass family bought a building at 244 Commissioner Street in old Johannesburg and part of the revitalised Maboneng to house their massive collection. It was an old face-bricked, eight-storey building which originally was an old clothing factory. In addition to books, the stock extended to antique maps, old engravings and prints, printed ephemera, periodicals, newspapers and photographs. They also curated and dealt in vinyl records and 78rpm discs. The shop housed an extensive range of small antiques and collectables, with a strong emphasis on the decorative arts between 1870-1970, glassware, ceramics and porcelain. Klass was the founding member and first chairman of the South African Bookdealers Association, the official body for out-of-print bookdealers in Southern Africa. He is survived by his brother Jonathan and sister-in-law Jenny, niece and nephew Mathew and Rebecca, and by his beloved partner, Gundi Weinick. Source: Kathy Munro, Heritage Portal Andrew Dickson (1940-2025) Former head of school in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Wits Professor Andrew John Dickson (BSc Eng 1962, MSc Eng 1964) died peacefully at the age of 84 in his home in Colorado, US. Dickson matriculated from St John’s College and he was awarded with both a graduate and master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Wits. He received a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology soon after and completed another master’s in electrical engineering. On returning to South Africa, he worked as an engineer in Mokopane for several years before returning to Wits as lecturer in Engineering Design in the School of Mechanical Engineering. Teaching was his first love. He was well-liked and respected by his students and fellow academics. He always had time to help his students and never turned anyone away from his door. In the early 1980s Eskom lured him back into the profession. He went on to have an illustrious career in Eskom and was, for many years, generation engineering manager. He played a major role in the team which included John Maree (BCom 1949) and Ian McRae (BSc Eng 1954, DSc Eng honoris causa 1989), who built Eskom into being one of the finest generation companies in the world at the time. In the mid-1990s he returned to Wits to take up the Eskom Chair of Engineering in the Faculty. He remained in that role until his retirement. Soon after retiring, he and his wife Pam (BSc 1962) moved to Colorado to be closer to their daughter Susan van den Heever (BSc 1989, PDipEd 1989, BSc Hons 1991, MSc 1995), who is a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University. Source: Dickson family Christopher Julian Cooke (1940-2025) Emeritus Professor in the School of Architecture, Planning and Geomatics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), Christopher Julian Cooke (BArch 1963, HDipTP 1972) died on 24 February 2025. Cooke, known affectionately as Julian, started teaching at UCT in 1976 and retired formally in 2000, serving as the dean in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, as well as director of the school. He played a pivotal role in forging various programmes, as well as creating a curriculum that questioned the status quo, was politically progressive and anti-apartheid. Student projects in both planning and architecture were regularly set in the urban and rural conditions of the apartheid city of Cape Town, and small towns nearby. Architecture was understood to not only be a formal artistic or sculptural endeavour, but also a socio-political one. He was editor of the journal Architecture SA from 1982 to 1987, and was re-appointed in 2003. He won several open architectural competitions in South Africa, and received many awards, including the South African Institute of Architects Gold Medal Award for architecture in 2015. Cooke’s most significant work was the hostels upgrade programme which comprised approximately 3000 units in Nyanga, Gugulethu and Langa. He said the squalid, barrack-like hostels reminded him of Charles Dickens’ “dark, satanic mills” of the European industrial revolution 150 years ago. The transformation took 15 years to accomplish, with Cooke establishing a relationship with the community he later he regarded as family. He described moments of beauty he encountered: “The difference between the living conditions and the way places are occupied says something profound about the greatness and resourcefulness of human beings. In one room we meet a woman who is carefully braiding her daughter’s hair. The child is sitting on a bed covered with an immaculately embroidered bedspread and on the wall next to her is a large, framed picture of a curly-haired Jesus. I find the irony in the juxtaposition of such care and beauty with the crude hostel block difficult to bear.” The project won the firm, Architects Associated, of which Cooke was part, the Impumelelo Innovations Award in 2004.His lectures were described as interesting and accessible. He came up with the idea of a project called “Ten dreams for Cape Town”. This was a project that brought together many architects and urban designers, to rethink and, importantly, to show, an alternative Cape Town that was more efficient, egalitarian and sustainable. This project culminated in a series of lectures for one of UCT’s Summer School courses in 2019, with an accompanying exhibition. It was later turned into a book titled A Vision for a Future Cape Town. He had an unwavering belief in the project of architecture and continued to teach long after retirement from the school as well as creating courses for UCT’s Summer School. He will be remembered as an “exemplary architect, urban designer, teacher and human being.” Sources: UCT and Artefacts Senamile Masango (1987-2025) One of South Africa’s trailblazing black female nuclear scientists, Senamile Masango (PDM 2021) died aged 37, from an unknown cause, on 8 February 2025. Dubbed “the queen of science”by some, Masango was born in KwaNongoma, in KwaZulu-Natal. She demonstrated a passion for learning and her family encouraged her to read extensively from an early age. She enrolled at the University of KwaZulu-Natal atthe age of 16 to pursue a Bachelor of Science in physics and electronics, followed by an honours degree in nuclear physics from the University of the Western Cape, where she conducted research on the B(E2) value in Neon-20. She completed a postgraduate diploma in energy leadership from Wits Business School. In 2017 Masango was part of the first African-led experiment at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), one of the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. Her many accomplishments include being South Africa’s research leader at the BRICS Youth Energy Outlook in 2019, where her foundation led the winning team in 2020. Recognised among the 50 Global Inspirational Women of 2020 and a Women in Tech Global Awards finalist in 2021 and 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community. She was the executive chairperson and founder of Mphathisithele Consulting PTY, and dedicated her career to empowering African women in STEM and advancing sustainable development goals. At the time of her death, she was completing her doctoral studies in nuclear physics and was the founder of Women in Science and Engineering (Wise). Through Wise, Masango provided leadership and role models for young women wishing to enter the fields of science and engineering. Proceeds made from her speaking engagements went towards raising money to provide science kits for disadvantaged schools. But throughout her career, Masango faced the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender. “The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think! There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,” she said. Sources: BBC and NECSA Mehnaaz Ally (1980-2025) Dr Mehnaaz Ally (MBBCh 2005) a dedicated paediatric palliative care practitioner, died on 6 February 2025. She was found unresponsive in her home after experiencing a massive internal brain haemorrhage. A touching “walk of honour”was held for Ally as an organ donor, as she arrived at Milpark Hospital on the morning after her death. A large crowd of people turned up to show their respects as she was wheeled through the ward. The request had been sent out to “wear bright colours” as homage to her positive and colourful personality. After completing her undergraduate degree in medicine from Wits in 2005, she pursued postgraduate studies in paediatrics, and then in paediatric palliative care. She successfully completed the post-graduate diploma in paediatric palliative medicine through the University of Cape Town in 2017, with distinction. She worked at various palliative care NGOs, including WitsPal (Wits Palliative Care at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital), the Lambano Sanctuary, a paediatric step-down unit and hospice faculty in Germiston, the Rare Diseases South Africa as well as PatchSA. According to her colleagues, her empathetic approach to care extended beyond clinical practice, she understood the importance of listening and advocacy. She was passionate about educating fellow healthcare workers about paediatric pain and had a special interest in neonatal pain and palliation. She also ran support groups and debriefing workshops for healthcare workers burdened by burnout and compassion fatigue. Sources: Rare Diseases South Africa , Lambano Sanctuary and PatchSA Harold Luntz (1937-2025) Harold Luntz (BA 1957, LLB 1959), who was Emeritus Professor at Melbourne Law School, died at the age of 87 on 29 January 2025. He was one of the world’s foremost scholars and theoreticians of torts and damages law. A much-loved colleague and lecturer, he authored numerous articles, incisive case notes, engaging book reviews, comments on the direction of the law and other publications. Luntz was born in Johannesburg, matriculating from Athlone Boys High School. After completing a Bachelor of Arts at Wits, he studied towards his LLB, serving articles of clerkship at the same time as undertaking the degree; both took three years. In 1960, he was employed for a brief period as a solicitor in a firm of solicitors in Johannesburg and then took a Bachelor of Civil Law at Lincoln College at the University of Oxford. He began publishing in academic journals in the early 1960s. He emigrated to Australia in 1965, joining the Faculty of Law as a senior lecturer. He excelled as a writer and teacher. In 1970, he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1976 was appointed George Paton Professor of Law, a position he held until his retirement in 2002. He also served as a successful Dean at the Melbourne University Law School from 1986 to 1988. Following his retirement, he continued to teach in the postgraduate programme until 2008. Luntz took time off in 1970 to pursue his interests in comparative law as visiting associate professor at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada. Later, in 1971, he was visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. But his commitment was to Melbourne and Australia. He returned as Reader in Law in July 1971. His professorial chair came in July 1976, and he served as dean over three years from 1986–88. He was twice a visiting fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford, where he was attached on each occasion to the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Melbourne in 1983. In 2000 he was the inaugural recipient of the John G Fleming Memorial Award for Torts Scholarship, and in 2003 he was awarded the AILA Insurance Law Prize. From 2007, the Harold Luntz Graduate Research Thesis Prize commemorating Luntz’s achievements as a “world expert on torts law” has been awarded annually to the Melbourne Law School graduate research student judged to have presented the best thesis in the previous year, provided that the nominee meets an overall level of excellence required for the award. The prize specifically honours Luntz’s contribution on the international stage and as a former dean. Luntz was made an Officer in the general division in the Order of Australia in the Australia Day 2019 Honours List “for distinguished service to legal education, as an academic and editor, to professional development and to the community”. After Luntz’s retirement, Justice Michael Kirby wrote a tribute in the Melbourne University Law Review in 2003 titled Harold Luntz: Doyen of the Australian Law of Torts , saying Luntz was a lawyer who, unusually, “listened before he spoke”, a man with a reputation for “reading everything”; loved by his students “because he was a good storyteller”; and throughout his long, illustrious career displayed three great strengths: commonsense, practical wisdom and plain speaking. Justice Kirby noted that Luntz’s childhood and experiences in South Africa shaped his outlook on justice profoundly: “His childhood and youth in that country had a profound effect upon his view of the world and of the law. South Africa was never a lawless state. That, indeed, was the central problem. It embalmed in law rules that anyone with sensitivity (and particularly anyone who was from a minority) could see were offensive to human equality, to personal autonomy and to the effective operation of law as an instrument of justice. I venture to suggest that those early years left a mark on Harold Luntz that has stayed with him ever since. They help to explain his sense of urgency, his great energy, his pursuit of justice through law and his search for a better home to give voice to these ideals.” Sources: The University of Melbourne, Wikipedia, Melbourne University Law Review In Memoriam 2024 Chabani Manganyi (1960-2024) Distinguished academic, scholar, intellectual activist, psychologist, and public servant Professor Noel Chabani Manganyi died on 31 October 2024. He was born in the district of Louis Trichardt and after his schooling, studied at the University of South Africa where he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962, received an honours degree in psychology in 1964, a master’s in 1968 and a doctorate in 1970 with a thesis titled Body Image in Paraplegia . As part of his doctoral requirements, he held an internship in clinical psychology at Baragwanath Hospital and was appointed as a clinical psychologist, a post he occupied for three years until he left to take up a post-doctoral fellowship at Yale from 1973 until 1975. Manganyi published a series of monographs – the first was Being Black in the World (Ravan 1973, WUP 2019), the last Looking Through the Keyhole (Ravan Press 1981). In these works, he examined the effects of institutionalised racism on the internal worlds and external realities of South Africans – including alienation, distorted relations with the body and quest for freedom. He was one of the few who, before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, took the psychological effects of racism on society seriously. Manganyi examined the effects of violence on individuals and groups in Mashangu’s Reverie (Ravan 1977), which explores the place of the Black Consciousness Movement as the antithesis of the dominant and racist culture – and is seminal in the field of psychology. The exploration of the phenomenon of violence is reprised and elaborated in his later publications. In 1976 he took up a professorship at the University of Transkei, where he established the Department of Psychology and served as its first chair. In 1980 he was appointed senior research fellow and visiting professor at Wits’ African Studies Institute. This was his home for 10 years and the place where he produced ideas that laid the foundation for his subsequent research. He continued his clinical practice part-time and spent 1985 back at Yale as a visiting fellow. In 1990, he became Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the University of the North. When a fully democratic government was established in 1994, Manganyi stepped into the office of director general in the Department of Education, a position he held until 1999, when he became advisor to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Pretoria (UP). In 2003, he was appointed Vice-Principal of UP, an office he held until March 2006. He served on the board of Wits University Press. The concept of identity creation and retrieval, the theme of Mashangu’s Reverie , in part led to the second phase of Manganyi’s literary production, which involved history and biography. He suggested that biography is the “stock-in-trade of a clinical psychologist” in the “study and reconstruction of lives both in health and disease”. The first life he chose to study was one of South Africa’s best-known authors in Exiles and Homecomings: A Biography of Es’kia Mphahlele (Ravan Press 1983). Later he studied the life of painter Gerard Sekoto, publishing A Black Man Called Sekoto (Ravan Press 1996), which was a finalist in the Sunday Times Alan Paton Award and Gerard Sekoto: I am an African (2006). This was followed by the volume edited with David Attwell, Bury Me at the Marketplace: Es’kia Mphahlele and Company. Letters 1943-2006 (WUP 2009), his memoir Apartheid and the Making of a Black Psychologist (WUP 2016) won the Academy of Science of South Africa’s Humanities Book Award. In 2024 his contribution was recognised by the Caribbean Philosophical Association when he was named a recipient of the Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award. When he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Wits in 2008, the citation read: “In the best Wits intellectual tradition Prof Manganyi has achieved enormous output, while remaining unassuming.” Sources: Wits archive and The Conversation John Simon (1938-2024) Respected actuary and loyal Wits supporter John Simon (BSc 1959) died peacefully from dementia and frailty at the age 86 on 31 October 2024. He was the son of Pearl and Herbert Simon, born on Crown Mines near Johannesburg in 1938.He grew up on mines along the Reef, later Benoni and finally in Westcliff, near the Johannesburg Zoo along with his younger brother Lyddon (BA Hons 1956, LLB 1958). Simon matriculated from King Edward VII School, which provided him with many stories of friends such as Michael Feldman and Michael Whippman (BSc Hons 1960) and enough education to study mathematics through a scholarship at Wits. He met Eddie Price (BSc 1960) and Martin Bloom (BCom 1961) at university, who became life-long friends. Although he was not the most effusive or extroverted man, he made a few lifelong friendships. He was awarded the William Cullen Medal as joint top graduate in mathematics in his final year and won the Rotary Scholarship to pursue a PhD in statistics at Princeton University. After a year, he decided that academia was not for him and went to London to study to become an actuary. While in London, in 1962, he met Sally Caplan, whom he married two years later and they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary in the summer of 2024. He began his actuarial studies while working at the Sun Life of Canada offices in Cheapside in the city. At that time the notoriously difficult actuarial training was undertaken through part-time studies while working full time. He was allowed Friday afternoons off for studying and worked tirelessly each evening and most weekends, never failing an exam, but it still took four years passing one or two subjects each year. He sat his final qualifying exams six weeks after the birth of his first child, Daniel. After Sun Life, he joined Bacon and Woodrow, a firm he stayed with until his retirement, save for a six-month sojourn at Rothschilds. He was highly respected in his field and much valued as a colleague. A few colleagues shared the following tributes about him after news of his death: “He was responsible for some of the firm’s largest clients, and had great client handling skills. He was also very good at developing staff”; “You could sum him up in three words: ability, amiability, approachability” and “the most gentle gentleman I knew”. He served his profession more widely, becoming Master of the Worshipful Company of Actuaries in 1994/5, “not bad for a boy from Benoni” he would say when invited to the Queen’s Garden Party. He lived with honesty and gave quietly to charities that mattered to him. He did most things quietly. Quietly spoken and a man of few words, his dementia made him progressively quieter and frail, but he never complained. “Where is it written it should be easy?” he had frequently said of life. His wife Sally, and three children – Daniel, a lawyer and senior partner at Collyer Bristow, London; Gideon, a senior consulting software engineer at Sagentia, Cambridge; Jessica, a palliative care specialist in Calgary, Canada, and eight grandchildren survive him.

On the news of his death, the family received messages from past students describing how they were inspired by him and how their lives were changed by his vision to uplift disadvantaged communities. Melville, who graduated from Wits in 1962 , was also a keen sportsman, representing the university in tennis and cross country. He taught mathematics and geography at various South African schools. In 1975 he was appointed vice-principal at Mondeor High School in Johannesburg, and in 1979 became principal at Lyttleton Manor High School. Between 1993 and 1997, Melville served as a superintendent for the Department of Education in the West Rand. With the advent of democracy in South Africa, he was appointed as a member of a two-man commission to evaluate four education departments and to formulate a strategy to establish one, multiracial department with a suitable examination system. He was also appointed to a board of commissioners to evaluate the credibility of the matriculation examination. In 1998, Melville registered a non-profit trust called the Edumap Education Development Trust, which was aimed at upgrading mathematics and physical science by providing academic enrichment courses to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It continues to do excellent work based on a transition model from secondary school level to tertiary level. This has ensured a 99% success rate at tertiary for the students who have attended the Edumap College . Melville served as a trustee and chairman of the South Deep Education Trust and the South Deep Community Trust between 2014 and 2023. He was a devoted family man who will be remembered for his work ethic, tenacity and generosity. He is survived by his wife Glenys, daughters Karen (BSc 1988, HDipEd 1989, BSc Hon 1990, MSc 2003, PhD 2013), Vanessa (BNurs 1993) and four grandchildren. Source: The Meville family Sifiso Dabengwa (1958-2024) Former MTN CEO and Eskom chair Sifiso Dabengwa (MBA 1993) died on 1 September 2024 at the age of 63 from cancer. The Zimbabwean-born executive had an electrical engineering degree from the University of Zimbabwe and an MBA from Wits Business School. As a youngster, he confessed to having no career aspirations, other than “to be an engineer”. When he completed his engineering degree, he did a few years as a trainee on British Rail. After that, he went to work on Zimbabwe Railways, before joining a consulting engineering firm based in Pretoria, where he worked on projects in Botswana, Swaziland and the former Bophuthatswana. He told WBS Journal that doing his MBA full-time changed his life: “In the sense that it was unique, because it created new opportunities for changing my career.” He said Nick Binedell, then director of WBS influenced him most. He joined Eskom on completing his MBA and left the parastatal as executive director of distribution to join MTN in 1999 as managing director of South African operations. Dabengwa was instrumental in guiding MTN through significant phases of growth and transformation across Africa between 2011 and 2015 as CEO. He was appointed to the Eskom board in January 2018, just before the country’s delegation went to the World Economic Forum in Davos to assure investors that it was cleaning up state-owned entities. He resigned from the position in 2020. MTN president and CEO Ralph Mupita said Dabengwa’s impact was significant. “Sifiso was respected not only for his professional achievements, but also [the] integrity, humility and the respect he showed to all who worked with him. He was a mentor to many and a leader who exemplified the values of commitment and service.” He was fiercely private and found talking about himself uncomfortable and being photographed disconcerting. He referred to himself as “one” rather than “me” and spoke very softly. He is survived by his wife, Naspers SA CEO Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa and four children.

Dr Froman served as chairman and president of the Israel Tennis Association and chairman of the Israel Tennis Centres for many years. He received the Israel Prize for his work in the field of sports and body culture in 1989 and was also awarded the International Jewish Spots Hall of Fame Pillar of Achievement Award. He was born in South Africa, the son of parents who were two of the founders of King David Linksfield, with his mother being the first headmistress. His love affair with tennis started at the age of four, and he played during his time at King Edward VII School. He reached the third round of the Wimbledon Championships in 1955 as an 18-year-old and was exposed to the likes of Jimmy Connors, Ilie Năstase, and Billie Jean King. Shortly after graduating from Wits, he made the squad for the South African Davis Cup team and was chosen for the Maccabi Games in 1961. In 1964 he immigrated to Israel with his wife and played for Israel in Davis Cup and later captained the team. In 1974 he left dentistry to devote himself full time to the sport saying: “Tennis is an educational sport because whether you are playing competitively or socially, you meet people from all backgrounds irrespective of their finances or religion.” He embarked on a huge project to fund the Israel Tennis Centre’s organisation that changed the face of the sport. It served as a breeding ground for the country’s top players. Dr Froman is survived by his wife Ruth, children Yarona, Amira, Philip and their families.

Also, to call the function, you need to use the name of said function. Maybe I confused you by including it in the print function call. So, you’ll need print(myfunc(numbers)) The reason I named the function list_even is that the name is descriptive of what the function is doing. The name I’ve used, such as x , was also not too helpful; sorry. What that does: the x in the function holds the list of numbers that has been passed to it, as in list_even(numbers) The list of numbers is passed to the function, which can use that list, which is held in the a local variable, x .

He was asking you to “fence” your code with a line of triple backticks top and bottom, like this: ```\n",
            " your code\n",
            " goes here\n",

Note: on my keyboard the backtick is at top left on the key with the tilde ( ~ ). The “smart quotes” left opening quote mark is not a backtick. On the web forum there’s a marker to insert code if you’d prefer that.

It would be better to write: if n % 2 == 0: which precisely expresses what you’re testing: whether the remainder is 0 when you divide by 2 . What Rob’s doing, while it works, depends on a number of Python specific things. The first is that applying the not logical operation to a value inverts its “truthiness” (yes, we really use that nonword), and returns a Boolean value ( True or False ). The same with if-statements: they also test the “truthiness” if their expression. The second is that there’s a convention in Python that the “truthiness” of an object is normally designed to be false for zero or empty things. So these are falsey examples: 0 , a int zero 0.0 , a float zero [] , an empty list () , an empty tuple None , the normal placeholder for “no value” (Python does not have a “no value”) \"\" , an empty string ( str ) Conversely, these test as true: 1 , a nonzero int 9 , another nonzero int [1,2,3] , a nonempty list \"abc\" , a nonempty str And this is a little reinforced because Booleans (Python’s bool type, True and False ) are in fact a special subclass of int , with 0 for False and 1 for True . Also, the expression not n % 2 relies on the operator precedence of % binding tighter than the operator precedence of not . Now it happens that arithmetic operators do bind tighter than logic operators, because that lets us write: if 3+5 > 0 and x+y > 9: and generally have it mean what we intend. But relying on that for an expression feels… slightly wobbly. You want to get the result of not(n%2) and not the result of (not n)%2 . So what Rob is doing is: computing the remainder when you divide by 2 testing its falsiness Now, a remainder of 0 does indeed test as falsey, and conversely nonzero tests as truthy. But that relies on a quirk of the language specification, not the inherent numeric situation, which should look like: n % 2 == 0 i.e. “is the remainder 0 ”? So I recommend that form to you.

That’s why you are getting the error. You seem to have a bit of confusion as to what name goes with what. In your myfunc function, you name the input argument “x”. But then you try to iterate over the function myfunc : def myfunc(x):\n",
            "    list_even = []\n",
            "    for n in myfunc:  # WRONG! Change to \"for n in x:\"\n",
            "        if not n %2:\n",
            "            list_even.append(n)\n",
            "    return list_even\n",

            "print(list_even(numbers))  # WRONG! Change to \"print(myfunc(numbers))\" We can improve this by choosing better names, that describe what the purpose of the function or variable is: def get_evens(list_of_numbers):\n",

            "print(get_evens(numbers)) What happens here is that when the interpreter gets to the line numbers = [2, 3, ...] it creates a list of numbers and gives it a name “numbers”. This is a global variable , because anywhere inside your script (the .py file) can see it – it is global to the entire script. When you pass the variable to the get_evens function, the interpreter takes the list and gives it a second name, “list_of_numbers”. Unlike the name “numbers”, which is global, “list_of_numbers” is a local variable so it is only visible to code inside the get_evens function. Being local to the get_evens function, if you try to refer to “list_of_numbers” outside of the get_evens function, you will get an error that the name doesn’t exist. The reason why the “numbers” list is defined underneath the function is… no particular reason. It is common practice to define your functions at the top of the .py file, and data below them, but it is not compulsary. The only thing that is mandatory is that the data and the function exists when you use them. # This is okay.\n",

By assigning a value to a variable ( args ) you throw away the original value. In effect you are ignoring the argument value given to the function. You need to work with the argument otherwise it does not make sense. print(even_list) - “ Print statements will not work here. ” The function does not return the result. You need to use the statement return to do that. You already did that in your earlier code. Why abandoning it here? I recommend you reading a little bit about functions.

Ask for all of them in the loop, one at a time. Your code only ever adds those 2 initial numbers together, and it does so repeatedly. It doesn’t add any new number to the total. The total is always the same, namely, the result of x + y . Your code should stop when the total exceeds 100, and you’re checking whether it exceeds 150, and even if it does exceed that value, you’re not breaking out of the loop. And finally, the variable names aren’t meaningful. You really need only 2 of them; personally I’d call them number and total . Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  6:04pm 3 Thank you for your help, i will re write me code and hopefully it shall work Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  7:03pm 4 while True:\n",

Try following it line by line, with a pencil and paper if necessary. 1 Like Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  7:24pm 6 Yes ok and what is that line of code that will allow it to keep adding by its self. in which part of my code is it wrong and stops the continous adding up. thanks MRAB (Matthew Barnett) January 8, 2023,  8:25pm 7 Basically, it should be like this: total is 0\n",

I apprectiate your time and effort MRAB (Matthew Barnett) January 9, 2023, 10:41pm 11 A final couple of points: When it exits the loop, answer will be over 100, so the if condition at the end is guaranteed to be true, and, therefore, there’s no need to check whether it’s true. Your original post says that the final message should be “OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!”, but your code prints only “OVERLOAD”. Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 10, 2023,  6:52am 12 Thank You rob42 (Rob) January 11, 2023,  4:46pm 13 You could optimize your code and also do a little error checking, as error checking any user input is a fundamental requirement.

I’ve got some comments on the example though. I’d be writing the try/except like this: try:\n",
            "     user_input = int(input(\"Integer> \"))\n",
            " except ValueError as e:\n",
            "     print(\"Value Error:\", e)\n",
            " else:\n",
            "     total += user_input\n",
            "     print(f\"Your total: {total}\") There are 2 changes there: second, the print recites the exception - you almost always want to report exactly what exeception occurred - it might not be what you expected first, the try/except surrounds the smallest possible piece of code so that you have confidence that it came from the user_input = line Narrow try/excepts are generally better, otherwise the exception might have come from almost anything.

So for a random duration of between 0 and 4 seconds you could do random()*4 , for between 2 and 4 seconds you could do random()*2+2 .

Here’s a better example: ```python\\ndef list_even(x):\\n    even = []\\n    for n in x:\\n        if not n %2:\\n            even.append(n)\\n    return even\\n\\nnumbers = [2,3,4,6,8,101,103,111,120,124]\\n\\nprint(list_even(numbers))\\n``` Not a worry; I think I can work with it. You’re using myfunc as both the name of your function and the operator for the for loop; not good. Also, to call the function, you need to use the name of said function. Maybe I confused you by including it in the print function call. So, you’ll need print(myfunc(numbers)) The reason I named the function list_even is that the name is descriptive of what the function is doing. The name I’ve used, such as x , was also not too helpful; sorry. What that does: the x in the function holds the list of numbers that has been passed to it, as in list_even(numbers) The list of numbers is passed to the function, which can use that list, which is held in the a local variable, x . You can see this if you put a print call in the function: def myfunc(x):\\n    print(x)\\n\\nnumbers = [2,3,4,6,8,101,103,111,120,124]\\nmyfunc(\\'Hello\\')\\nmyfunc(101)\\nmyfunc(numbers) cameron (Cameron Simpson) September 16, 2022, 12:51am 7 By Dave via Discussions on Python.org at 15Sep2022 22:36: def myfunc(x): ‘’‘’‘’‘‘list_even = ‘’’’‘’‘‘for n in myfunc: ‘’’’‘’‘’‘’‘’‘’\\'if not n %2: I don’t think that’s what Rob meant. He was asking you to “fence” your code with a line of triple backticks top and bottom, like this: ```\\n your code\\n goes here\\n ``` This preserves the indentation and punctuation in the code, making it much easier for the reader. The same for output or error messages. Note: on my keyboard the backtick is at top left on the key with the tilde ( ~ ). The “smart quotes” left opening quote mark is not a backtick. On the web forum there’s a marker to insert code if you’d prefer that.

It would be better to write: if n % 2 == 0: which precisely expresses what you’re testing: whether the remainder is 0 when you divide by 2 . What Rob’s doing, while it works, depends on a number of Python specific things. The first is that applying the not logical operation to a value inverts its “truthiness” (yes, we really use that nonword), and returns a Boolean value ( True or False ). The same with if-statements: they also test the “truthiness” if their expression. The second is that there’s a convention in Python that the “truthiness” of an object is normally designed to be false for zero or empty things. So these are falsey examples: 0 , a int zero 0.0 , a float zero [] , an empty list () , an empty tuple None , the normal placeholder for “no value” (Python does not have a “no value”) \"\" , an empty string ( str ) Conversely, these test as true: 1 , a nonzero int 9 , another nonzero int [1,2,3] , a nonempty list \"abc\" , a nonempty str And this is a little reinforced because Booleans (Python’s bool type, True and False ) are in fact a special subclass of int , with 0 for False and 1 for True . Also, the expression not n % 2 relies on the operator precedence of % binding tighter than the operator precedence of not . Now it happens that arithmetic operators do bind tighter than logic operators, because that lets us write: if 3+5 > 0 and x+y > 9: and generally have it mean what we intend. But relying on that for an expression feels… slightly wobbly. You want to get the result of not(n%2) and not the result of (not n)%2 . So what Rob is doing is: computing the remainder when you divide by 2 testing its falsiness Now, a remainder of 0 does indeed test as falsey, and conversely nonzero tests as truthy. But that relies on a quirk of the language specification, not the inherent numeric situation, which should look like: n % 2 == 0 i.e. “is the remainder 0 ”? So I recommend that form to you.

To be fair to @Peekay that was in the original code posted; it’s a bad coding habit that I’ve picked up from somewhere; I’ll try to drop it. 1 Like steven.daprano (Steven D\\'Aprano) September 16, 2022, 10:27am 10 Dave, in your variation of the code you name the function “myfunc”, but then try to call a non-existent function “list_even”. That’s why you are getting the error. You seem to have a bit of confusion as to what name goes with what. In your myfunc function, you name the input argument “x”. But then you try to iterate over the function myfunc : def myfunc(x):\\n    list_even = []\\n    for n in myfunc:  # WRONG! Change to \"for n in x:\"\\n        if not n %2:\\n            list_even.append(n)\\n    return list_even\\n\\nnumbers = [2,3,4,6,8,101,103,111,120,124]\\nprint(list_even(numbers))  # WRONG! Change to \"print(myfunc(numbers))\" We can improve this by choosing better names, that describe what the purpose of the function or variable is: def get_evens(list_of_numbers):\\n    list_of_evens = []\\n    for n in list_of_numbers:\\n        if n % 2 != 0:\\n            list_of_evens.append(n)\\n    return list_of_evens\\n\\nnumbers = [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 101, 103, 111, 120, 124]\\nprint(get_evens(numbers)) What happens here is that when the interpreter gets to the line numbers = [2, 3, ...] it creates a list of numbers and gives it a name “numbers”. This is a global variable , because anywhere inside your script (the .py file) can see it – it is global to the entire script. When you pass the variable to the get_evens function, the interpreter takes the list and gives it a second name, “list_of_numbers”. Unlike the name “numbers”, which is global, “list_of_numbers” is a local variable so it is only visible to code inside the get_evens function. Being local to the get_evens function, if you try to refer to “list_of_numbers” outside of the get_evens function, you will get an error that the name doesn’t exist. The reason why the “numbers” list is defined underneath the function is… no particular reason. It is common practice to define your functions at the top of the .py file, and data below them, but it is not compulsary. The only thing that is mandatory is that the data and the function exists when you use them. # This is okay.\\n\\nmy_name = \\'Steve\\'\\n\\ndef greet(name):\\n    print(\"Hello\", name)\\n\\ngreet(my_name)\\n\\n# This is also okay.\\n\\ndef salutations(name):\\n    print(\"Greetings and salutations\", name)\\n\\nyour_name = \\'Dave\\'\\nsalutations(my_name)\\n\\n# But this section is NOT OKAY and will fail.\\n\\nsay_goodnight(her_name)\\n# It fails because the function and the variable don\\'t exist yet!\\n# You will get a NameError exception.\\n\\nher_name = \\'Gracie\\'\\n\\ndef say_goodnight(name):\\n    print(\"Say goodnight,\", name)\\n    print(\"Goodnight\", name + \"!\") Hope this helps explain why and when the interpreter will see a name versus complaining it doesn’t exist. Peekay (Dave) September 16, 2022, 11:16am 11 Thanks you guys , this has VERY educational. Steven… the procedure you ammended works by producing the correct output but is still creating an error.  Keep in mind, I am in an education software practice exercise so the error may not actually be a Python error but something related to the course.  see below, do you recognize this error? “myfunc takes 1 positional argument but 5 were given” def myfunc(x):\\n    list_even = []\\n    for n in x:  \\n        if n %2 == 0:\\n            list_even.append(n)\\n    return list_even\\n\\nnumbers = [2,3,4,6,8,101,103,111,120,124]\\nprint(myfunc(numbers)) vbrozik (Václav Brožík) September 16, 2022, 12:38pm 12 Dave: do you recognize this error? Yes, it is a Python’s error message used with the TypeError exception. It says that the function myfunc() was defined to accept a single argument but it was called with five arguments instead. Here is a short demonstration: >>> def myfunc(x):\\n...     return x\\n...\\n>>> myfunc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: myfunc() takes 1 positional argument but 5 were given I guess you might not be following the assignment exactly (a  guessed hint: Maybe it is not your code which should call myfunc() ). Try to re-read it carefully and if you are still out of ideas what could be wrong, show us the exact text of the assignment. Peekay (Dave) September 16, 2022,  1:20pm 13 This is the exact problem verbatim.  And yes, now getting more confused \" Define a function called myfunc that takes in an arbitrary number of arguments, and returns a list containing only those arguments that are even. Remember, don’t run the function, simply provide the definition. To give an idea what the function would look like when tested: myfunc(5,6,7,8) Output: [6, 8] Added note: this exercise requires that the function return a list.

Have you seen this error before? vbrozik (Václav Brožík) September 16, 2022,  2:43pm 15 Ok, now you follow these two instructions which were not followed before: Define a function … that takes in an arbitrary number of arguments Remember, don’t run the function , simply provide the definition. I see that you are ignoring the args argument. As you show the function it does not matter how you call it. It will always return the same list. The error message seems to compare the expected output to the actual output of your function (which is None ). I am wondering does the message show the testing input? I noticed this later (because I did not expect that): Now you are not following these instructions: Define a function called myfunc that … returns a list containing only those arguments that are even. Added note: this exercise requires that the function return a list. Print statements will not work here. Peekay (Dave) September 16, 2022,  4:39pm 16 The *args should satisfy the arbitrary number of values requirement.  I just uncertain how to produce the same output using “return”  I’ve tried it, it keeps telling me “undefined” Peekay (Dave) September 16, 2022,  4:45pm 17 def myfunc(numlist):\\n    numlist=([0,1,4,8,10,1000,4002,5003,1000000,7,9,12])\\n    list(filter(lambda num:num%2 ==0,numlist)) this is a variation I’m toying with.  It’s actually one of the same procedures the instructor uses. This is producing an error as well relating to the numberb of variables it’s expecting.  Any ideas ? vbrozik (Václav Brožík) September 16, 2022,  7:39pm 18 Let’s go back to this code of yours: Dave: def myfunc(*args):\\n    args=[3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 102, 2002, 4001, 5004]\\n    number_list = args\\n    even_list=[]\\n    for x in number_list:  \\n        if x %2 == 0:\\n            even_list.append(x)\\n    print(even_list) More concrete hints: args=[3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 102, 2002, 4001, 5004] - What is the purpose of this statement? By assigning a value to a variable ( args ) you throw away the original value. In effect you are ignoring the argument value given to the function. You need to work with the argument otherwise it does not make sense. print(even_list) - “ Print statements will not work here. ” The function does not return the result. You need to use the statement return to do that. You already did that in your earlier code. Why abandoning it here? I recommend you reading a little bit about functions.

The above are tildes ( ~ ). def myfunc(numlist): numlist=([0,1,4,8,10,1000,4002,5003,1000000,7,9,12]) list(filter(lambda num:num%2 ==0,numlist)) this is a variation I’m toying with.  It’s actually one of the same procedures the instructor uses. This is producing an error as well relating to the numberb of variables it’s expecting.  Any ideas ? This function expects exactly one argument ( numlist ). To accept an arbitrary number of arguments you want a definition like this: def myfunc(*numbers): The asterisk ( * ) says to collect all positional arguments and save them in the variable numbers . Number isn’t a list , it is a tuple , but that doesn’t matter for your function - you can still iterate over it to pick out the even numbers. Example use of the asterisk in the parameters: >>> def f(*a):\\n ...   print(type(a), a)\\n ...\\n >>>\\n >>>\\n >>> f(1,2,3)\\n <class \\'tuple\\'> (1, 2, 3) so the variable a is a tuple of 3 values.

It offers several advantages over the float datatype: Decimal â\\x80\\x9cis based on a floating-point model which was designed with people\\nin mind, and necessarily has a paramount guiding principle â\\x80\\x93 computers must\\nprovide an arithmetic that works in the same way as the arithmetic that\\npeople learn at school.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 excerpt from the decimal arithmetic specification. Decimal numbers can be represented exactly.  In contrast, numbers like 1.1 and 2.2 do not have exact representations in binary\\nfloating point. End users typically would not expect 1.1 + 2.2 to display\\nas 3.3000000000000003 as it does with binary floating point. The exactness carries over into arithmetic.  In decimal floating point, 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 is exactly equal to zero.  In binary floating point, the result\\nis 5.5511151231257827e-017 .  While near to zero, the differences\\nprevent reliable equality testing and differences can accumulate. For this\\nreason, decimal is preferred in accounting applications which have strict\\nequality invariants. The decimal module incorporates a notion of significant places so that 1.30 + 1.20 is 2.50 .  The trailing zero is kept to indicate significance.\\nThis is the customary presentation for monetary applications. For\\nmultiplication, the â\\x80\\x9cschoolbookâ\\x80\\x9d approach uses all the figures in the\\nmultiplicands.  For instance, 1.3 * 1.2 gives 1.56 while 1.30 * 1.20 gives 1.5600 . Unlike hardware based binary floating point, the decimal module has a user\\nalterable precision (defaulting to 28 places) which can be as large as needed for\\na given problem: >>> from decimal import * >>> getcontext () . prec = 6 >>> Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal(\\'0.142857\\') >>> getcontext () . prec = 28 >>> Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal(\\'0.1428571428571428571428571429\\') Both binary and decimal floating point are implemented in terms of published\\nstandards.  While the built-in float type exposes only a modest portion of its\\ncapabilities, the decimal module exposes all required parts of the standard.\\nWhen needed, the programmer has full control over rounding and signal handling.\\nThis includes an option to enforce exact arithmetic by using exceptions\\nto block any inexact operations. The decimal module was designed to support â\\x80\\x9cwithout prejudice, both exact\\nunrounded decimal arithmetic (sometimes called fixed-point arithmetic)\\nand rounded floating-point arithmetic.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x93 excerpt from the decimal\\narithmetic specification. The module design is centered around three concepts:  the decimal number, the\\ncontext for arithmetic, and signals. A decimal number is immutable.  It has a sign, coefficient digits, and an\\nexponent.  To preserve significance, the coefficient digits do not truncate\\ntrailing zeros.  Decimals also include special values such as Infinity , -Infinity , and NaN .  The standard also\\ndifferentiates -0 from +0 . The context for arithmetic is an environment specifying precision, rounding\\nrules, limits on exponents, flags indicating the results of operations, and trap\\nenablers which determine whether signals are treated as exceptions.  Rounding\\noptions include ROUND_CEILING , ROUND_DOWN , ROUND_FLOOR , ROUND_HALF_DOWN , ROUND_HALF_EVEN , ROUND_HALF_UP , ROUND_UP , and ROUND_05UP . Signals are groups of exceptional conditions arising during the course of\\ncomputation.  Depending on the needs of the application, signals may be ignored,\\nconsidered as informational, or treated as exceptions. The signals in the\\ndecimal module are: Clamped , InvalidOperation , DivisionByZero , Inexact , Rounded , Subnormal , Overflow , Underflow and FloatOperation . For each signal there is a flag and a trap enabler.  When a signal is\\nencountered, its flag is set to one, then, if the trap enabler is\\nset to one, an exception is raised.  Flags are sticky, so the user needs to\\nreset them before monitoring a calculation. See also IBMâ\\x80\\x99s General Decimal Arithmetic Specification, The General Decimal Arithmetic\\nSpecification . Quick-start tutorial Â¶ The usual start to using decimals is importing the module, viewing the current\\ncontext with getcontext() and, if necessary, setting new values for\\nprecision, rounding, or enabled traps: >>> from decimal import * >>> getcontext () Context(prec=28, rounding=ROUND_HALF_EVEN, Emin=-999999, Emax=999999, capitals=1, clamp=0, flags=[], traps=[Overflow, DivisionByZero, InvalidOperation]) >>> getcontext () . prec = 7 # Set a new precision Decimal instances can be constructed from integers, strings, floats, or tuples.\\nConstruction from an integer or a float performs an exact conversion of the\\nvalue of that integer or float.  Decimal numbers include special values such as NaN which stands for â\\x80\\x9cNot a numberâ\\x80\\x9d, positive and negative Infinity , and -0 : >>> getcontext () . prec = 28 >>> Decimal ( 10 ) Decimal(\\'10\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'3.14\\' ) Decimal(\\'3.14\\') >>> Decimal ( 3.14 ) Decimal(\\'3.140000000000000124344978758017532527446746826171875\\') >>> Decimal (( 0 , ( 3 , 1 , 4 ), - 2 )) Decimal(\\'3.14\\') >>> Decimal ( str ( 2.0 ** 0.5 )) Decimal(\\'1.4142135623730951\\') >>> Decimal ( 2 ) ** Decimal ( \\'0.5\\' ) Decimal(\\'1.414213562373095048801688724\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'NaN\\' ) Decimal(\\'NaN\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'-Infinity\\' ) Decimal(\\'-Infinity\\') If the FloatOperation signal is trapped, accidental mixing of\\ndecimals and floats in constructors or ordering comparisons raises\\nan exception: >>> c = getcontext () >>> c . traps [ FloatOperation ] = True >>> Decimal ( 3.14 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> decimal.FloatOperation : [<class \\'decimal.FloatOperation\\'>] >>> Decimal ( \\'3.5\\' ) < 3.7 Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> decimal.FloatOperation : [<class \\'decimal.FloatOperation\\'>] >>> Decimal ( \\'3.5\\' ) == 3.5 True Added in version 3.3. The significance of a new Decimal is determined solely by the number of digits\\ninput.  Context precision and rounding only come into play during arithmetic\\noperations. >>> getcontext () . prec = 6 >>> Decimal ( \\'3.0\\' ) Decimal(\\'3.0\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'3.1415926535\\' ) Decimal(\\'3.1415926535\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'3.1415926535\\' ) + Decimal ( \\'2.7182818285\\' ) Decimal(\\'5.85987\\') >>> getcontext () . rounding = ROUND_UP >>> Decimal ( \\'3.1415926535\\' ) + Decimal ( \\'2.7182818285\\' ) Decimal(\\'5.85988\\') If the internal limits of the C version are exceeded, constructing\\na decimal raises InvalidOperation : >>> Decimal ( \"1e9999999999999999999\" ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> decimal.InvalidOperation : [<class \\'decimal.InvalidOperation\\'>] Changed in version 3.3. Decimals interact well with much of the rest of Python.  Here is a small decimal\\nfloating-point flying circus: >>> data = list ( map ( Decimal , \\'1.34 1.87 3.45 2.35 1.00 0.03 9.25\\' . split ())) >>> max ( data ) Decimal(\\'9.25\\') >>> min ( data ) Decimal(\\'0.03\\') >>> sorted ( data ) [Decimal(\\'0.03\\'), Decimal(\\'1.00\\'), Decimal(\\'1.34\\'), Decimal(\\'1.87\\'), Decimal(\\'2.35\\'), Decimal(\\'3.45\\'), Decimal(\\'9.25\\')] >>> sum ( data ) Decimal(\\'19.29\\') >>> a , b , c = data [: 3 ] >>> str ( a ) \\'1.34\\' >>> float ( a ) 1.34 >>> round ( a , 1 ) Decimal(\\'1.3\\') >>> int ( a ) 1 >>> a * 5 Decimal(\\'6.70\\') >>> a * b Decimal(\\'2.5058\\') >>> c % a Decimal(\\'0.77\\') And some mathematical functions are also available to Decimal: >>> getcontext () . prec = 28 >>> Decimal ( 2 ) . sqrt () Decimal(\\'1.414213562373095048801688724\\') >>> Decimal ( 1 ) . exp () Decimal(\\'2.718281828459045235360287471\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'10\\' ) . ln () Decimal(\\'2.302585092994045684017991455\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'10\\' ) . log10 () Decimal(\\'1\\') The quantize() method rounds a number to a fixed exponent.  This method is\\nuseful for monetary applications that often round results to a fixed number of\\nplaces: >>> Decimal ( \\'7.325\\' ) . quantize ( Decimal ( \\'.01\\' ), rounding = ROUND_DOWN ) Decimal(\\'7.32\\') >>> Decimal ( \\'7.325\\' ) . quantize ( Decimal ( \\'1.\\' ), rounding = ROUND_UP ) Decimal(\\'8\\') As shown above, the getcontext() function accesses the current context and\\nallows the settings to be changed.  This approach meets the needs of most\\napplications. For more advanced work, it may be useful to create alternate contexts using the\\nContext() constructor.  To make an alternate active, use the setcontext() function. In accordance with the standard, the decimal module provides two ready to\\nuse standard contexts, BasicContext and ExtendedContext . The\\nformer is especially useful for debugging because many of the traps are\\nenabled: >>> myothercontext = Context ( prec = 60 , rounding = ROUND_HALF_DOWN ) >>> setcontext ( myothercontext ) >>> Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal(\\'0.142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857142857\\') >>> ExtendedContext Context(prec=9, rounding=ROUND_HALF_EVEN, Emin=-999999, Emax=999999, capitals=1, clamp=0, flags=[], traps=[]) >>> setcontext ( ExtendedContext ) >>> Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal(\\'0.142857143\\') >>> Decimal ( 42 ) / Decimal ( 0 ) Decimal(\\'Infinity\\') >>> setcontext ( BasicContext ) >>> Decimal ( 42 ) / Decimal ( 0 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<pyshell#143>\" , line 1 , in -toplevel- Decimal ( 42 ) / Decimal ( 0 ) DivisionByZero : x / 0 Contexts also have signal flags for monitoring exceptional conditions\\nencountered during computations.  The flags remain set until explicitly cleared,\\nso it is best to clear the flags before each set of monitored computations by\\nusing the clear_flags() method. >>> setcontext ( ExtendedContext ) >>> getcontext () . clear_flags () >>> Decimal ( 355 ) / Decimal ( 113 ) Decimal(\\'3.14159292\\') >>> getcontext () Context(prec=9, rounding=ROUND_HALF_EVEN, Emin=-999999, Emax=999999, capitals=1, clamp=0, flags=[Inexact, Rounded], traps=[]) The flags entry shows that the rational approximation to pi was\\nrounded (digits beyond the context precision were thrown away) and that the\\nresult is inexact (some of the discarded digits were non-zero). Individual traps are set using the dictionary in the traps attribute of a context: >>> setcontext ( ExtendedContext ) >>> Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 0 ) Decimal(\\'Infinity\\') >>> getcontext () . traps [ DivisionByZero ] = 1 >>> Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 0 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<pyshell#112>\" , line 1 , in -toplevel- Decimal ( 1 ) / Decimal ( 0 ) DivisionByZero : x / 0 Most programs adjust the current context only once, at the beginning of the\\nprogram.  And, in many applications, data is converted to Decimal with\\na single cast inside a loop.  With context set and decimals created, the bulk of\\nthe program manipulates the data no differently than with other Python numeric\\ntypes. Decimal objects Â¶ class decimal. Decimal ( value = \\'0\\' , context = None ) Â¶ Construct a new Decimal object based from value . value can be an integer, string, tuple, float , or another Decimal object.

If value is a\\nstring, it should conform to the decimal numeric string syntax after leading\\nand trailing whitespace characters, as well as underscores throughout, are removed: sign : := \\'+\\' | \\'-\\' digit : := \\'0\\' | \\'1\\' | \\'2\\' | \\'3\\' | \\'4\\' | \\'5\\' | \\'6\\' | \\'7\\' | \\'8\\' | \\'9\\' indicator : := \\'e\\' | \\'E\\' digits : := digit [ digit ] ... decimal - part : := digits \\'.\\' [ digits ] | [ \\'.\\' ] digits exponent - part : := indicator [ sign ] digits infinity : := \\'Infinity\\' | \\'Inf\\' nan : := \\'NaN\\' [ digits ] | \\'sNaN\\' [ digits ] numeric - value : := decimal - part [ exponent - part ] | infinity numeric - string : := [ sign ] numeric - value | [ sign ] nan Other Unicode decimal digits are also permitted where digit appears above.  These include decimal digits from various other\\nalphabets (for example, Arabic-Indic and DevanÄ\\x81garÄ« digits) along\\nwith the fullwidth digits \\'\\\\uff10\\' through \\'\\\\uff19\\' .\\nCase is not significant, so, for example, inf , Inf , INFINITY ,\\nand iNfINity are all acceptable spellings for positive infinity. If value is a tuple , it should have three components, a sign\\n( 0 for positive or 1 for negative), a tuple of\\ndigits, and an integer exponent. For example, Decimal((0, (1, 4, 1, 4), -3)) returns Decimal(\\'1.414\\') . If value is a float , the binary floating-point value is losslessly\\nconverted to its exact decimal equivalent.  This conversion can often require\\n53 or more digits of precision.  For example, Decimal(float(\\'1.1\\')) converts to Decimal(\\'1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625\\') . The context precision does not affect how many digits are stored. That is\\ndetermined exclusively by the number of digits in value . For example, Decimal(\\'3.00000\\') records all five zeros even if the context precision is\\nonly three. The purpose of the context argument is determining what to do if value is a\\nmalformed string.  If the context traps InvalidOperation , an exception\\nis raised; otherwise, the constructor returns a new Decimal with the value of NaN . Once constructed, Decimal objects are immutable. Changed in version 3.2: The argument to the constructor is now permitted to be a float instance. Changed in version 3.3: float arguments raise an exception if the FloatOperation trap is set. By default the trap is off. Changed in version 3.6: Underscores are allowed for grouping, as with integral and floating-point\\nliterals in code. Decimal floating-point objects share many properties with the other built-in\\nnumeric types such as float and int .  All of the usual math\\noperations and special methods apply.  Likewise, decimal objects can be\\ncopied, pickled, printed, used as dictionary keys, used as set elements,\\ncompared, sorted, and coerced to another type (such as float or int ). There are some small differences between arithmetic on Decimal objects and\\narithmetic on integers and floats.  When the remainder operator % is\\napplied to Decimal objects, the sign of the result is the sign of the dividend rather than the sign of the divisor: >>> ( - 7 ) % 4 1 >>> Decimal ( - 7 ) % Decimal ( 4 ) Decimal(\\'-3\\') The integer division operator // behaves analogously, returning the\\ninteger part of the true quotient (truncating towards zero) rather than its\\nfloor, so as to preserve the usual identity x == (x // y) * y + x % y : >>> - 7 // 4 -2 >>> Decimal ( - 7 ) // Decimal ( 4 ) Decimal(\\'-1\\') The % and // operators implement the remainder and divide-integer operations (respectively) as described in the\\nspecification. Decimal objects cannot generally be combined with floats or\\ninstances of fractions.Fraction in arithmetic operations:\\nan attempt to add a Decimal to a float , for\\nexample, will raise a TypeError .  However, it is possible to\\nuse Pythonâ\\x80\\x99s comparison operators to compare a Decimal instance x with another number y .  This avoids confusing results\\nwhen doing equality comparisons between numbers of different types. Changed in version 3.2: Mixed-type comparisons between Decimal instances and other\\nnumeric types are now fully supported. In addition to the standard numeric properties, decimal floating-point\\nobjects also have a number of specialized methods: adjusted ( ) Â¶ Return the adjusted exponent after shifting out the coefficientâ\\x80\\x99s\\nrightmost digits until only the lead digit remains: Decimal(\\'321e+5\\').adjusted() returns seven.  Used for determining the\\nposition of the most significant digit with respect to the decimal point. as_integer_ratio ( ) Â¶ Return a pair (n, d) of integers that represent the given Decimal instance as a fraction, in lowest terms and\\nwith a positive denominator: >>> Decimal ( \\'-3.14\\' ) . as_integer_ratio () (-157, 50) The conversion is exact.  Raise OverflowError on infinities and ValueError\\non NaNs. Added in version 3.6. as_tuple ( ) Â¶ Return a named tuple representation of the number: DecimalTuple(sign, digits, exponent) . canonical ( ) Â¶ Return the canonical encoding of the argument.  Currently, the encoding of\\na Decimal instance is always canonical, so this operation returns\\nits argument unchanged. compare ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Compare the values of two Decimal instances. compare() returns a\\nDecimal instance, and if either operand is a NaN then the result is a\\nNaN: a or b is a NaN ==> Decimal ( \\'NaN\\' ) a < b ==> Decimal ( \\'-1\\' ) a == b ==> Decimal ( \\'0\\' ) a > b ==> Decimal ( \\'1\\' ) compare_signal ( other , context = None ) Â¶ This operation is identical to the compare() method, except that all\\nNaNs signal.  That is, if neither operand is a signaling NaN then any\\nquiet NaN operand is treated as though it were a signaling NaN. compare_total ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Compare two operands using their abstract representation rather than their\\nnumerical value.  Similar to the compare() method, but the result\\ngives a total ordering on Decimal instances.  Two Decimal instances with the same numeric value but different\\nrepresentations compare unequal in this ordering: >>> Decimal ( \\'12.0\\' ) . compare_total ( Decimal ( \\'12\\' )) Decimal(\\'-1\\') Quiet and signaling NaNs are also included in the total ordering.  The\\nresult of this function is Decimal(\\'0\\') if both operands have the same\\nrepresentation, Decimal(\\'-1\\') if the first operand is lower in the\\ntotal order than the second, and Decimal(\\'1\\') if the first operand is\\nhigher in the total order than the second operand.  See the specification\\nfor details of the total order. This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed\\nand no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise\\nInvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly. compare_total_mag ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Compare two operands using their abstract representation rather than their\\nvalue as in compare_total() , but ignoring the sign of each operand. x.compare_total_mag(y) is equivalent to x.copy_abs().compare_total(y.copy_abs()) . This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed\\nand no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise\\nInvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly. conjugate ( ) Â¶ Just returns self, this method is only to comply with the Decimal\\nSpecification. copy_abs ( ) Â¶ Return the absolute value of the argument.  This operation is unaffected\\nby the context and is quiet: no flags are changed and no rounding is\\nperformed. copy_negate ( ) Â¶ Return the negation of the argument.  This operation is unaffected by the\\ncontext and is quiet: no flags are changed and no rounding is performed. copy_sign ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Return a copy of the first operand with the sign set to be the same as the\\nsign of the second operand.  For example: >>> Decimal ( \\'2.3\\' ) . copy_sign ( Decimal ( \\'-1.5\\' )) Decimal(\\'-2.3\\') This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed\\nand no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise\\nInvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly. exp ( context = None ) Â¶ Return the value of the (natural) exponential function e**x at the\\ngiven number.  The result is correctly rounded using the ROUND_HALF_EVEN rounding mode. >>> Decimal ( 1 ) . exp () Decimal(\\'2.718281828459045235360287471\\') >>> Decimal ( 321 ) . exp () Decimal(\\'2.561702493119680037517373933E+139\\') classmethod from_float ( f ) Â¶ Alternative constructor that only accepts instances of float or int . Note Decimal.from_float(0.1) is not the same as Decimal(\\'0.1\\') .\\nSince 0.1 is not exactly representable in binary floating point, the\\nvalue is stored as the nearest representable value which is 0x1.999999999999ap-4 .  That equivalent value in decimal is 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 . Note From Python 3.2 onwards, a Decimal instance\\ncan also be constructed directly from a float . >>> Decimal . from_float ( 0.1 ) Decimal(\\'0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\\') >>> Decimal . from_float ( float ( \\'nan\\' )) Decimal(\\'NaN\\') >>> Decimal . from_float ( float ( \\'inf\\' )) Decimal(\\'Infinity\\') >>> Decimal . from_float ( float ( \\'-inf\\' )) Decimal(\\'-Infinity\\') Added in version 3.1. fma ( other , third , context = None ) Â¶ Fused multiply-add.  Return self*other+third with no rounding of the\\nintermediate product self*other. >>> Decimal ( 2 ) . fma ( 3 , 5 ) Decimal(\\'11\\') is_canonical ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is canonical and False otherwise.  Currently, a Decimal instance is always canonical, so\\nthis operation always returns True . is_finite ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is a finite number, and False if the argument is an infinity or a NaN. is_infinite ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is either positive or negative\\ninfinity and False otherwise. is_nan ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is a (quiet or signaling) NaN and False otherwise. is_normal ( context = None ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is a normal finite number.  Return False if the argument is zero, subnormal, infinite or a NaN. is_qnan ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is a quiet NaN, and False otherwise. is_signed ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument has a negative sign and False otherwise.  Note that zeros and NaNs can both carry signs. is_snan ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is a signaling NaN and False otherwise. is_subnormal ( context = None ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is subnormal, and False otherwise. is_zero ( ) Â¶ Return True if the argument is a (positive or negative) zero and False otherwise. ln ( context = None ) Â¶ Return the natural (base e) logarithm of the operand.  The result is\\ncorrectly rounded using the ROUND_HALF_EVEN rounding mode. log10 ( context = None ) Â¶ Return the base ten logarithm of the operand.  The result is correctly\\nrounded using the ROUND_HALF_EVEN rounding mode. logb ( context = None ) Â¶ For a nonzero number, return the adjusted exponent of its operand as a Decimal instance.  If the operand is a zero then Decimal(\\'-Infinity\\') is returned and the DivisionByZero flag\\nis raised.  If the operand is an infinity then Decimal(\\'Infinity\\') is\\nreturned. logical_and ( other , context = None ) Â¶ logical_and() is a logical operation which takes two logical\\noperands (see Logical operands ).  The result is the\\ndigit-wise and of the two operands. logical_invert ( context = None ) Â¶ logical_invert() is a logical operation.  The\\nresult is the digit-wise inversion of the operand. logical_or ( other , context = None ) Â¶ logical_or() is a logical operation which takes two logical\\noperands (see Logical operands ).  The result is the\\ndigit-wise or of the two operands. logical_xor ( other , context = None ) Â¶ logical_xor() is a logical operation which takes two logical\\noperands (see Logical operands ).  The result is the\\ndigit-wise exclusive or of the two operands. max ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Like max(self, other) except that the context rounding rule is applied\\nbefore returning and that NaN values are either signaled or\\nignored (depending on the context and whether they are signaling or\\nquiet). max_mag ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Similar to the max() method, but the comparison is done using the\\nabsolute values of the operands. min ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Like min(self, other) except that the context rounding rule is applied\\nbefore returning and that NaN values are either signaled or\\nignored (depending on the context and whether they are signaling or\\nquiet). min_mag ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Similar to the min() method, but the comparison is done using the\\nabsolute values of the operands. next_minus ( context = None ) Â¶ Return the largest number representable in the given context (or in the\\ncurrent threadâ\\x80\\x99s context if no context is given) that is smaller than the\\ngiven operand. next_plus ( context = None ) Â¶ Return the smallest number representable in the given context (or in the\\ncurrent threadâ\\x80\\x99s context if no context is given) that is larger than the\\ngiven operand. next_toward ( other , context = None ) Â¶ If the two operands are unequal, return the number closest to the first\\noperand in the direction of the second operand.  If both operands are\\nnumerically equal, return a copy of the first operand with the sign set to\\nbe the same as the sign of the second operand. normalize ( context = None ) Â¶ Used for producing canonical values of an equivalence\\nclass within either the current context or the specified context. This has the same semantics as the unary plus operation, except that if\\nthe final result is finite it is reduced to its simplest form, with all\\ntrailing zeros removed and its sign preserved. That is, while the\\ncoefficient is non-zero and a multiple of ten the coefficient is divided\\nby ten and the exponent is incremented by 1. Otherwise (the coefficient is\\nzero) the exponent is set to 0. In all cases the sign is unchanged. For example, Decimal(\\'32.100\\') and Decimal(\\'0.321000e+2\\') both\\nnormalize to the equivalent value Decimal(\\'32.1\\') . Note that rounding is applied before reducing to simplest form. In the latest versions of the specification, this operation is also known\\nas reduce . number_class ( context = None ) Â¶ Return a string describing the class of the operand.  The returned value\\nis one of the following ten strings. \"-Infinity\" , indicating that the operand is negative infinity. \"-Normal\" , indicating that the operand is a negative normal number. \"-Subnormal\" , indicating that the operand is negative and subnormal. \"-Zero\" , indicating that the operand is a negative zero. \"+Zero\" , indicating that the operand is a positive zero. \"+Subnormal\" , indicating that the operand is positive and subnormal. \"+Normal\" , indicating that the operand is a positive normal number. \"+Infinity\" , indicating that the operand is positive infinity. \"NaN\" , indicating that the operand is a quiet NaN (Not a Number). \"sNaN\" , indicating that the operand is a signaling NaN. quantize ( exp , rounding = None , context = None ) Â¶ Return a value equal to the first operand after rounding and having the\\nexponent of the second operand. >>> Decimal ( \\'1.41421356\\' ) . quantize ( Decimal ( \\'1.000\\' )) Decimal(\\'1.414\\') Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the\\nquantize operation would be greater than precision, then an InvalidOperation is signaled. This guarantees that, unless there\\nis an error condition, the quantized exponent is always equal to that of\\nthe right-hand operand. Also unlike other operations, quantize never signals Underflow, even if\\nthe result is subnormal and inexact. If the exponent of the second operand is larger than that of the first\\nthen rounding may be necessary.  In this case, the rounding mode is\\ndetermined by the rounding argument if given, else by the given context argument; if neither argument is given the rounding mode of\\nthe current threadâ\\x80\\x99s context is used. An error is returned whenever the resulting exponent is greater than Emax or less than Etiny() . radix ( ) Â¶ Return Decimal(10) , the radix (base) in which the Decimal class does all its arithmetic.  Included for compatibility with the\\nspecification. remainder_near ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Return the remainder from dividing self by other .  This differs from self % other in that the sign of the remainder is chosen so as to\\nminimize its absolute value.  More precisely, the return value is self - n * other where n is the integer nearest to the exact\\nvalue of self / other , and if two integers are equally near then the\\neven one is chosen. If the result is zero then its sign will be the sign of self . >>> Decimal ( 18 ) . remainder_near ( Decimal ( 10 )) Decimal(\\'-2\\') >>> Decimal ( 25 ) . remainder_near ( Decimal ( 10 )) Decimal(\\'5\\') >>> Decimal ( 35 ) . remainder_near ( Decimal ( 10 )) Decimal(\\'-5\\') rotate ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Return the result of rotating the digits of the first operand by an amount\\nspecified by the second operand.  The second operand must be an integer in\\nthe range -precision through precision.  The absolute value of the second\\noperand gives the number of places to rotate.  If the second operand is\\npositive then rotation is to the left; otherwise rotation is to the right.\\nThe coefficient of the first operand is padded on the left with zeros to\\nlength precision if necessary.  The sign and exponent of the first operand\\nare unchanged. same_quantum ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Test whether self and other have the same exponent or whether both are NaN . This operation is unaffected by context and is quiet: no flags are changed\\nand no rounding is performed.  As an exception, the C version may raise\\nInvalidOperation if the second operand cannot be converted exactly. scaleb ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Return the first operand with exponent adjusted by the second.\\nEquivalently, return the first operand multiplied by 10**other .  The\\nsecond operand must be an integer. shift ( other , context = None ) Â¶ Return the result of shifting the digits of the first operand by an amount\\nspecified by the second operand.  The second operand must be an integer in\\nthe range -precision through precision.  The absolute value of the second\\noperand gives the number of places to shift.  If the second operand is\\npositive then the shift is to the left; otherwise the shif...

Task: Create a program using a while loop that keeps asking a user to enter a number and adds those numbers together to a total. When the total goes over 100, the program stops and outputs: “OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!” So far this is what i have written: x = int(input(\"Enter a number\"))\\ny = int(input(\"Enter another number\"))\\nz = None\\nwhile True:\\n    z = x + y\\n    \\n    if z <= 150:\\n        print(\"your total is\", z)\\n        print(\"Enter another number\")\\n        w = int(input())\\n        print( z + w )\\n    else:\\n        print(\"your total is\", z)\\n        print(\"OVERLORD\") thanks for all the help MRAB (Matthew Barnett) January 8, 2023,  5:46pm 2 Why does it ask for the first 2 numbers before the loop? Ask for all of them in the loop, one at a time. Your code only ever adds those 2 initial numbers together, and it does so repeatedly. It doesn’t add any new number to the total. The total is always the same, namely, the result of x + y . Your code should stop when the total exceeds 100, and you’re checking whether it exceeds 150, and even if it does exceed that value, you’re not breaking out of the loop. And finally, the variable names aren’t meaningful. You really need only 2 of them; personally I’d call them number and total . Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  6:04pm 3 Thank you for your help, i will re write me code and hopefully it shall work Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  7:03pm 4 while True:\\n    Number1 = int(input(\"Enter a number\"))\\n    Number2 = int(input(\"Enter another number\"))\\n    answer = Number1 + Number2\\n    print(answer)\\n    \\n    if answer < 100:\\n        print(\"Enter number\")\\n        Number3 = int(input())\\n        while answer < 100:\\n            answer += Number3\\n    else:\\n        print(\"overload\") why does this code not work. It does not continuosly add up the numbers. it will only add the first two numbers, then the next two numbers seperately. Any help? MRAB (Matthew Barnett) January 8, 2023,  7:13pm 5 It’s doing exactly what you’re telling it to do: ask for 2 numbers; ask for another number and keep adding it until the limit is reached; repeat all of that. Try following it line by line, with a pencil and paper if necessary. 1 Like Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  7:24pm 6 Yes ok and what is that line of code that will allow it to keep adding by its self. in which part of my code is it wrong and stops the continous adding up. thanks MRAB (Matthew Barnett) January 8, 2023,  8:25pm 7 Basically, it should be like this: total is 0\\nrepeat\\n    ask for number\\n    add number to total\\n    print total\\n    if total too big\\n        print overload message\\n        break out of loop but in Python. Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 8, 2023,  8:45pm 8 thanks for that, ill edit my code and be back with you Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 9, 2023,  8:49pm 9 hi there, your code you have sent me would work perfectly but you are implying that the numbers given by the user will be bigger than 100. what the numbers are smaller than 100, then the code should say ‘enter another number’ and will add that to the original number and continue to do so untill overload. that is where a while loop needs to be introduced and is also where i need help. thanks Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 9, 2023,  9:07pm 10 Hello Matthew, i have figured out the code and the problems. this is my final piece: Number3 = None\\n\\nNumber1 = int(input(\"Enter a number\"))\\nNumber2 = int(input(\"Enter another number\"))\\nanswer = Number1 + Number2\\nprint(answer)\\n\\nwhile answer <= 100:\\n    Number3 = int(input(\"Enter another number\"))\\n    answer = answer + Number3\\n    print(answer)\\n\\n\\nif answer >= 100:\\n    print(\"OVERLOAD\") it will work as suppose to. thank you for you help. I apprectiate your time and effort MRAB (Matthew Barnett) January 9, 2023, 10:41pm 11 A final couple of points: When it exits the loop, answer will be over 100, so the if condition at the end is guaranteed to be true, and, therefore, there’s no need to check whether it’s true. Your original post says that the final message should be “OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!”, but your code prints only “OVERLOAD”. Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 10, 2023,  6:52am 12 Thank You rob42 (Rob) January 11, 2023,  4:46pm 13 You could optimize your code and also do a little error checking, as error checking any user input is a fundamental requirement. One way would be thus: total = 0\\nwhile total <= 100:\\n    try:\\n        user_input = int(input(\"Integer> \"))\\n        total += user_input\\n        print(f\"Your total: {total}\")\\n    except ValueError:\\n        print(\"Value Error\")\\n\\nprint(\"OVERLOAD! You have gone over 100!\") 1 Like Guri (Gurleen Singh) January 12, 2023,  5:01pm 14 thanks Rob, this is something i never thought of rob42 (Rob) January 12, 2023,  5:10pm 15 You’re welcome; only to happy to help. 1 Like cameron (Cameron Simpson) January 12, 2023,  9:39pm 16 Indeed. I’ve got some comments on the example though. I’d be writing the try/except like this: try:\\n     user_input = int(input(\"Integer> \"))\\n except ValueError as e:\\n     print(\"Value Error:\", e)\\n else:\\n     total += user_input\\n     print(f\"Your total: {total}\") There are 2 changes there: second, the print recites the exception - you almost always want to report exactly what exeception occurred - it might not be what you expected first, the try/except surrounds the smallest possible piece of code so that you have confidence that it came from the user_input = line Narrow try/excepts are generally better, otherwise the exception might have come from almost anything. Cheers, Cameron Simpson cs@cskk.id.au 1 Like rob42 (Rob) January 12, 2023,  9:45pm 17 Thank you for your comments; very informative. aivarpaalberg (Aivar Paalberg) January 13, 2023,  1:29pm 18 Some more ideas. I would prefer move user_input outside the try…except, this way more useful information can be provided to user. It also could be good idea to have only conversion to int under try. Something like: user_input = input(\"Enter integer> \")\\n\\ntry:\\n    num = int(user_input)\\nexcept ValueError:\\n     print(f\"Expected integer but {user_input!r} was entered\")\\nelse:\\n     # do something with num if ValueError is not raised Home Categories Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled\\n', 'tool_call_id': 'call_9DzY438ZjWCqEfJyMhuSF5jq'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': \"Title: C++ DataFrame vs. Polars : r/Python\\nSnippet: Nov 9, 2023 ...

Thank you. (Picture attached for context) image 2158×1240 191 KB TParsons November 25, 2020,  2:09pm 2 You can use Python code for the Start/Stop/Duration values of components - the function random() will generate a random number between 0 and 1 so you can use this to pick a random time. So for a random duration of between 0 and 4 seconds you could do random()*4 , for between 2 and 4 seconds you could do random()*2+2 .

The team finished with a record of 100–62 and won the World Series . The series victory was the 21st title in franchise history and the first under the ownership of George Steinbrenner . New York was managed by Billy Martin and played at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx . The season was brought to life years later in the book and drama-documentary, The Bronx is Burning . The Yankees also hosted the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game . To date, this is the most recent time the All-Star Game host team has won the World Series the same year. Offseason [ edit ] The Yankees signed Reggie Jackson to a five-year contract, totaling $ 2.96 million, on November 29, 1976. Upon arriving in New York, Jackson asked for uniform number 9, which he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore . However, that number was being worn by third baseman Graig Nettles . So, noting that then-all-time home run leader Hank Aaron had just retired, Jackson asked for and received number 44, Aaron's number. Notable transactions [ edit ] November 5, 1976: Jim Mason was drafted from the Yankees by the Toronto Blue Jays as the 30th pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft . [ 1 ] January 11, 1977: Willie McGee was drafted by the Yankees in the first round (15th pick) of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft (secondary phase) and he signed on June 6. [ 2 ] January 20, 1977: Elliott Maddox and Rick Bladt were traded by the Yankees to the Baltimore Orioles for Paul Blair . [ 3 ] February 17, 1977: Sandy Alomar Sr. was traded by the Yankees to the Texas Rangers for Brian Doyle , Greg Pryor and cash. [ 4 ] March 26, 1977: Kerry Dineen was traded by the Yankees to the Philadelphia Phillies for Sergio Ferrer . [ 5 ] Regular season [ edit ] The team finished in first place in the American League East with a record of 100–62 (.617),  2½ games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles to successfully defend their division title. In the best-of-five League Championship Series (ALCS), they beat the Kansas City Royals in five games. In the World Series , New York defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.

The National League defeated the American League 7–5.

Although team owner George Steinbrenner and several players, most notably catcher and team captain Thurman Munson and outfielder Lou Piniella , were excited about his arrival, Martin was not. He had managed the Detroit Tigers in 1972 when Jackson's A's beat them in the league playoffs . Jackson was once quoted as saying of Martin, \"I hate him, but if I played for him, I'd probably love him.\" The relationship between Jackson and his new teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward . During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida , Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's version of the story is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be \"the straw that stirs the drink.\" But when the story appeared in the May 1977 issue of SPORT , Ward quoted Jackson as saying, \"This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad.\" Thurman Munson [ edit ] Thurman Munson was \"uncharacteristically happy\" about the team getting Jackson in large part because he believed he had received \"a verbal agreement from Steinbrenner that, with the exception of Catfish Hunter (who'd signed a five-year, $3.75 million contract with the Yankees before the 1975 season), he [Munson] would always be the highest-paid player on the team.\"  But, Steinbrenner did not follow through and adjust Munson's contract upward.  As the baseball book Stars and Strikes: Baseball and America in the Bicentennial Summer of ‘76 puts it, \"But the Yankee captain wouldn't be smiling for long, once he realized that Steinbrenner had no intention of making good on their agreement.\" [ 12 ] An article in The New York Times in January 1977 reported, \"Munson, however, has continued to be disturbed with Steinbrenner because of what he said first was the owner's denial of any verbal agreement and secand [second] was Steinbrenner's misleading him on Jackson's salary.\" [ 13 ] Billy Martin [ edit ] Martin feuded publicly with both Yankee owner Steinbrenner and star outfielder Jackson. In one especially infamous incident on Saturday, June 18, in the second game of a three-game sweep by the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park , Martin pulled Jackson off the field in mid-inning for failing to hustle on a check-swing pop double by Boston's Jim Rice . Replaced in right field by Paul Blair, Jackson confronted Martin when he returned to the dugout, and Martin had to be restrained by his coaches ( Elston Howard and Yogi Berra ) from fighting with Jackson during the nationally televised Game of the Week . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Jonathan Mahler wrote a bestselling book entitled Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning about the turmoil in New York City in 1977, including the Son of Sam , the blackout , and how Yankees season rallied the people of New York.  The book was adapted for an ESPN miniseries, The Bronx Is Burning The 1977 Yankees season provides a backdrop in the Spike Lee film Summer of Sam .

The team finished with a record of 100–62 and won the World Series . The series victory was the 21st title in franchise history and the first under the ownership of George Steinbrenner . New York was managed by Billy Martin and played at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx . The season was brought to life years later in the book and drama-documentary, The Bronx is Burning . The Yankees also hosted the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game . To date, this is the most recent time the All-Star Game host team has won the World Series the same year. Offseason [ edit ] The Yankees signed Reggie Jackson to a five-year contract, totaling $ 2.96 million, on November 29, 1976. Upon arriving in New York, Jackson asked for uniform number 9, which he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore . However, that number was being worn by third baseman Graig Nettles . So, noting that then-all-time home run leader Hank Aaron had just retired, Jackson asked for and received number 44, Aaron\\'s number. Notable transactions [ edit ] November 5, 1976: Jim Mason was drafted from the Yankees by the Toronto Blue Jays as the 30th pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft . [ 1 ] January 11, 1977: Willie McGee was drafted by the Yankees in the first round (15th pick) of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft (secondary phase) and he signed on June 6. [ 2 ] January 20, 1977: Elliott Maddox and Rick Bladt were traded by the Yankees to the Baltimore Orioles for Paul Blair . [ 3 ] February 17, 1977: Sandy Alomar Sr. was traded by the Yankees to the Texas Rangers for Brian Doyle , Greg Pryor and cash. [ 4 ] March 26, 1977: Kerry Dineen was traded by the Yankees to the Philadelphia Phillies for Sergio Ferrer . [ 5 ] Regular season [ edit ] The team finished in first place in the American League East with a record of 100–62 (.617),  2½ games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles to successfully defend their division title. In the best-of-five League Championship Series (ALCS), they beat the Kansas City Royals in five games. In the World Series , New York defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.

Although team owner George Steinbrenner and several players, most notably catcher and team captain Thurman Munson and outfielder Lou Piniella , were excited about his arrival, Martin was not. He had managed the Detroit Tigers in 1972 when Jackson\\'s A\\'s beat them in the league playoffs . Jackson was once quoted as saying of Martin, \"I hate him, but if I played for him, I\\'d probably love him.\" The relationship between Jackson and his new teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward . During spring training at the Yankees\\' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida , Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson\\'s version of the story is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be \"the straw that stirs the drink.\" But when the story appeared in the May 1977 issue of SPORT , Ward quoted Jackson as saying, \"This team, it all flows from me. I\\'m the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad.\" Thurman Munson [ edit ] Thurman Munson was \"uncharacteristically happy\" about the team getting Jackson in large part because he believed he had received \"a verbal agreement from Steinbrenner that, with the exception of Catfish Hunter (who\\'d signed a five-year, $3.75 million contract with the Yankees before the 1975 season), he [Munson] would always be the highest-paid player on the team.\"  But, Steinbrenner did not follow through and adjust Munson\\'s contract upward.  As the baseball book Stars and Strikes: Baseball and America in the Bicentennial Summer of ‘76 puts it, \"But the Yankee captain wouldn\\'t be smiling for long, once he realized that Steinbrenner had no intention of making good on their agreement.\" [ 12 ] An article in The New York Times in January 1977 reported, \"Munson, however, has continued to be disturbed with Steinbrenner because of what he said first was the owner\\'s denial of any verbal agreement and secand [second] was Steinbrenner\\'s misleading him on Jackson\\'s salary.\" [ 13 ] Billy Martin [ edit ] Martin feuded publicly with both Yankee owner Steinbrenner and star outfielder Jackson. In one especially infamous incident on Saturday, June 18, in the second game of a three-game sweep by the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park , Martin pulled Jackson off the field in mid-inning for failing to hustle on a check-swing pop double by Boston\\'s Jim Rice . Replaced in right field by Paul Blair, Jackson confronted Martin when he returned to the dugout, and Martin had to be restrained by his coaches ( Elston Howard and Yogi Berra ) from fighting with Jackson during the nationally televised Game of the Week . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Jonathan Mahler wrote a bestselling book entitled Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning about the turmoil in New York City in 1977, including the Son of Sam , the blackout , and how Yankees season rallied the people of New York.  The book was adapted for an ESPN miniseries, The Bronx Is Burning The 1977 Yankees season provides a backdrop in the Spike Lee film Summer of Sam .

Mather is a Senior Astrophysicist in the Observational Cosmology Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. His research centers on infrared astronomy and cosmology. As an NRC postdoctoral fellow at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (New York City), he led the proposal efforts for the Cosmic Background Explorer (74-76), and came to GSFC to be the Study Scientist (76-88), Project Scientist (88-98), and also the Principal Investigator for the Far IR Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on COBE. He showed that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a blackbody spectrum within 50 ppm. As Senior Project Scientist (95-present) for the James Webb Space Telescope, he leads the science team, and represents scientific interests within the project management.

Nuestra Vía Láctea está repleta de nubes moleculares gigantes que dan origen a \\nestrellas. Por lo que vemos aquí, los astrónomos suponen que el proceso de \\ncreación de estrellas también se desarrolla de manera similar en otras galaxias. \\nTiene sentido ya que sus estrellas tienen que formarse de alguna manera. Ahora, \\ngracias al JWST, los astrónomos han detectado objetos estelares bebés en una \\ngalaxia a 2,7 millones de años luz de distancia. Eso es millones de años luz más \\ndistante que cualquier observación previa de estrellas recién formadas. Los objetivos de las observaciones del JWST son los \" objetos estelares \\njóvenes \" (YSO, por sus siglas en inglés) en la galaxia Triangulum (M33). Los astrónomos utilizaron el generador de imágenes de infrarrojo medio \\n(MIRI) del telescopio para estudiar una sección de uno de los brazos espirales \\nde M33 en busca de YSO. Encontraron 793 de estas estrellas jóvenes escondidas \\ndentro de enormes nubes de gas y polvo. Se trata de un descubrimiento \\nimportante, que indica que los procesos de nacimiento de estrellas que conocemos \\ntan bien en nuestra galaxia se producen como esperamos que ocurran en otras.

Una \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tatmósfera con poco carbono podría ser un signo de agua y vida en \\n\\t\\t\\t\\totros planetas terrestres Por Jennifer Chu, MIT. 29 de diciembre de 2023. Los científicos del MIT en colaboración con la Universidad de Birmingham, \\napuntan a que la mejor oportunidad para los astrónomos de encontrar agua \\nlíquida, e incluso vida en otros planetas, es buscar la ausencia, más que la \\npresencia, de una característica química en sus atmósferas. Los investigadores \\nproponen que si un planeta terrestre tiene sustancialmente menos dióxido de \\ncarbono en su atmósfera en comparación con otros planetas del mismo sistema, \\npodría ser una señal de agua líquida (y posiblemente vida) en la superficie de \\nese planeta. Es más, esta nueva firma está en la mira del Telescopio Espacial James Webb \\n(JWST) de la NASA. Si bien los científicos han propuesto otros signos de \\nhabitabilidad, esas características son difíciles, si no imposibles, de medir \\ncon las tecnologías actuales. El equipo dice que esta nueva señal, de dióxido de \\ncarbono relativamente agotado, es el único signo de habitabilidad detectable \\nahora. Hasta ahora, los astrónomos han detectado más de 5.200 mundos más allá de \\nnuestro Sistema Solar. Con los telescopios actuales, los astrónomos pueden medir \\ndirectamente la distancia de un planeta a su estrella y el tiempo que le toma \\ncompletar una órbita.

Durante décadas, los autores de ciencia ficción han imaginado escenarios en los \\nque la vida prospera en las duras superficies de Marte o nuestra luna, o en los \\nocéanos debajo de las superficies heladas de Encelado, la luna de Saturno, y \\nEuropa, la luna de Júpiter. Pero el estudio de la habitabilidad (las condiciones \\nnecesarias para sustentar y sostener la vida) no se limita sólo a las páginas de \\nficción. A medida que se investigan más cuerpos planetarios en nuestro Sistema \\nSolar y más allá por su potencial para albergar condiciones favorables para la \\nvida, los investigadores debaten cómo caracterizar la habitabilidad. Si bien muchos estudios se han centrado en la información obtenida mediante \\nnaves espaciales en órbita o telescopios que proporcionan vistas instantáneas de \\nmundos oceánicos y exoplanetas, un nuevo artículo enfatiza la importancia de \\ninvestigar factores geofísicos complejos que puedan usarse para predecir el \\nmantenimiento de la vida a largo plazo. Estos factores incluyen cómo fluyen la \\nenergía y los nutrientes por todo el planeta.

Los núcleos de las estrellas de neutrones contienen materia en las densidades \\nmás altas alcanzadas en nuestro Universo actual, con hasta dos masas solares de \\nmateria comprimidas dentro de una esfera de 25 km de diámetro. De hecho, estos \\nobjetos astrofísicos pueden considerarse como \\x93 núcleos atómicos gigantes \\x94, \\ncuya gravedad comprime sus núcleos a densidades que exceden en muchas veces las \\nde los protones y neutrones individuales. Estas densidades hacen que las estrellas de neutrones sean objetos astrofísicos \\ninteresantes desde el punto de vista de la física nuclear y de partículas. Un \\nproblema abierto desde hace mucho tiempo es si la inmensa presión central de las \\nestrellas de neutrones puede comprimir protones y neutrones en una nueva fase de \\nla materia, conocida como materia de quarks fríos. En este exótico estado de la \\nmateria, los protones y neutrones individuales ya no existen. \" Los quarks y \\ngluones que los constituyen se liberan de su típico confinamiento de color y se \\nles permite moverse casi libremente \", explica Aleksi Vuorinen, profesor de \\nfísica teórica de partículas en la Universidad de Helsinki.

Aunque se \\nconocía OP 313 a energías más bajas, nunca se había detectado por encima de 100 \\nGeV, lo que convierte a este en el primer descubrimiento científico del LST-1. Con estos resultados, OP 313 se convierte en el núcleo galáctico activo (AGN) \\nmás distante jamás detectado por un telescopio Cherenkov, lo que demuestra aún \\nmás el rendimiento excepcional del prototipo LST mientras se pone en servicio en \\nel sitio CTAO-North en la isla de La Palma, España. OP 313 es lo que se conoce como Cuásar de Radio de Espectro Plano o FSRQ, un \\ntipo de AGN. Se trata de objetos muy luminosos que se encuentran en los centros \\nde algunas galaxias, donde un agujero negro supermasivo devora material de su \\nentorno, creando potentes discos de acreción y chorros de luz y partículas \\nrelativistas.

Nos encontramos en un momento en el que se ha vuelto casi habitual descubrir \\nplanetas orbitando otra estrella, habiéndose registrado ya más de 5.000. Los \\nprimeros mundos distantes en incorporar esta lista fueron principalmente \\nplanetas gigantes, similares pero también muy diferentes en muchos aspectos a \\nJúpiter y Saturno. \\nLos astrofísicos ya han comenzado a obtener datos sobre las atmósferas de los \\nexoplanetas, pero aún quedan por responder preguntas fundamentales sobre la \\natmósfera del planeta más grande del Sistema Solar. Para comprender lo que \\nsucede en las nubes y capas de aire de Júpiter, es necesario estudiarlo a lo \\nlargo del tiempo en observaciones continuas. Por primera vez, un instrumento desarrollado para encontrar y analizar mundos a \\naños luz de distancia, exoplanetas, ha apuntado a un objetivo en el Sistema \\nSolar, a 43 minutos luz de la Tierra: el planeta Júpiter. Investigadores del \\nInstituto de Astrofísica y Ciencias Espaciales (IA) de la Facultad de Ciencias \\nde la Universidad de Lisboa (Portugal) (Ciências ULisboa) utilizaron el \\nespectrógrafo ESPRESSO instalado en el telescopio VLT del Observatorio Europeo \\nAustral (ESO) para medir la velocidad del viento en Júpiter, los resultados se \\npublican ahora en la revista Universe .

Un equipo de investigadores ha analizado más de 1 millón de galaxias para \\nexplorar el origen de las estructuras cósmicas actuales, como se informa en un \\nestudio reciente publicado en Physical Review D como sugerencia de los \\neditores. Hasta hoy, observaciones y análisis precisos del fondo cósmico de \\nmicroondas (CMB) y de la estructura a gran escala (LSS) han llevado al \\nestablecimiento del modelo estándar del Universo, el llamado modelo ΛCDM , \\ndonde la materia oscura fría (CDM) y la energía oscura (la constante \\ncosmológica, Λ) son características significativas. Este modelo sugiere que las fluctuaciones primordiales se generaron al comienzo \\ndel Universo, o en el Universo temprano, que actuaron como desencadenantes, \\nllevando a la creación de todas las cosas en el Universo, incluidas estrellas, \\ngalaxias, cúmulos de galaxias y su distribución espacial en todo el espacio. \\nAunque son muy pequeñas cuando se generan, las fluctuaciones crecen con el \\ntiempo debido a la fuerza de atracción gravitacional, formando eventualmente una \\nregión densa de materia oscura o un halo. Luego, diferentes halos colisionaron y \\nfusionaron repetidamente entre sí, dando lugar a la formación de objetos \\ncelestes como las galaxias.

Una vasta llanura \" sin rasgos distintivos \" en Marte sorprendió a los \\ninvestigadores al revelar un pasado geológico mucho más tumultuoso de lo \\nesperado, según un estudio dirigido por investigadores de la Universidad de \\nArizona. Enormes cantidades de lava brotaron de numerosas fisuras hace apenas 1 \\nmillón de años, cubriendo un área casi tan grande como Alaska e interactuando \\ncon el agua dentro y debajo de la superficie, lo que resultó en grandes \\ninundaciones que excavaron canales profundos. Al carecer de placas tectónicas (trozos de corteza en movimiento que remodelan \\nconstantemente la superficie de la Tierra), durante mucho tiempo se ha pensado \\nque Marte es un planeta geológicamente \" muerto \" donde no sucede mucho. \\nSin embargo, descubrimientos recientes hacen que los investigadores cuestionen \\nesta noción. El año pasado, un equipo de científicos planetarios, también en la \\nUniversidad de Arizona, presentó evidencia de una columna de manto gigante \\ndebajo de la región de Elysium Planitia , lo que provocó una intensa \\nactividad volcánica y sísmica en un pasado relativamente reciente.

Los investigadores creen que estudios \\ncomo este podrían revolucionar nuestra comprensión de la vida de las galaxias \\nmás activas cuando el Universo era joven. Cuando el universo era joven, las \\ngalaxias eran muy diferentes de las majestuosas espirales actuales, que están \\nllenas de soles suavemente brillantes y coloridas nubes de gas. Nuevas estrellas \\nestaban naciendo a un ritmo cientos de veces más rápido que en el Universo \\nactual. La mayor parte, sin embargo, estaba oculta detrás de gruesas capas de polvo, lo \\nque hacía que fuera un desafío para los científicos descubrir las fábricas de \\nestas estrellas, secretas hasta ahora. Al estudiar las galaxias más distantes \\nvisibles con potentes telescopios, los astrónomos pueden vislumbrar cómo estas \\nfábricas han logrado crear tantas estrellas. En un nuevo estudio, publicado en \\nla revista Astronomy &.

Las enanas marrones son objetos que se encuentran a ambos lados de la línea \\ndivisoria entre estrellas y planetas. Se forman como estrellas y se vuelven lo \\nsuficientemente densas como para colapsar bajo su propia gravedad, pero nunca se \\nvuelven lo suficientemente densas y calientes como para comenzar a fusionar \\nhidrógeno y convertirse en una estrella. En el extremo inferior de la escala, \\nalgunas enanas marrones son comparables con planetas gigantes, que pesan sólo \\nunas pocas veces la masa de Júpiter. A las enanas marrones a veces se les llama estrellas fallidas, ya que se forman \\ncomo estrellas mediante un colapso gravitacional, pero nunca ganan suficiente \\nmasa para iniciar una fusión nuclear. Las enanas marrones más pequeñas pueden \\nsuperponerse en masa a los planetas gigantes. En una búsqueda para encontrar la \\nenana marrón más pequeña, los astrónomos utilizando el Telescopio Espacial James \\nWebb de NASA/ESA/CSA han encontrado el nuevo poseedor del récord: un objeto que \\npesa sólo tres o cuatro veces la masa de Júpiter.

Científicos del Instituto Leibniz de Astrofísica de Potsdam (AIP) han \\ndescubierto una nueva inestabilidad del plasma que promete revolucionar nuestra \\ncomprensión del origen de los rayos cósmicos y su impacto dinámico en las \\ngalaxias. A principios del siglo pasado, Victor Hess descubrió un nuevo fenómeno \\nllamado rayos cósmicos que más tarde le valió el premio Nobel. Realizó vuelos en \\nglobo a gran altitud para descubrir que la atmósfera de la Tierra no está \\nionizada por la radiactividad del suelo. En cambio, confirmó que el origen de la ionización era extraterrestre. \\nPosteriormente, se determinó que los \"rayos\" consisten en partículas cargadas \\ndel espacio exterior que vuelan cerca de la velocidad de la luz en lugar de \\nradiación. Sin embargo, el nombre \" rayos cósmicos \" sobrevivió a estos \\nhallazgos. En el nuevo estudio, el Dr. Mohamad Shalaby, científicos del AIP y \\nautor principal de este estudio, hizo un seguimiento de las trayectorias de \\nmuchas partículas de rayos cósmicos y estudiar cómo interactúan con el plasma \\ncircundante formado por electrones y protones.

Una \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnueva teoría de la materia oscura explica dos enigmas de la \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastrofísica Por Iqbal Pittalwala, \\nUniversidad de California \\x96 Riverside. 07 de diciembre de 2023. Se cree que \\nconstituye el 85% de la materia del Universo, la materia oscura no es luminosa y \\nsu naturaleza no se comprende bien. Mientras que la materia normal absorbe, \\nrefleja y emite luz, la materia oscura no se puede ver directamente, lo que \\ndificulta su detección. Una teoría llamada \" materia oscura autointeractiva \" \\no SIDM, propone que las partículas de materia oscura interactúan entre sí a \\ntravés de una fuerza oscura, chocando fuertemente entre sí cerca del centro de \\nuna galaxia. En un trabajo \\npublicado en The Astrophysical Journal Letters , un equipo de \\ninvestigación dirigido por Hai-Bo Yu, profesor de física y astronomía en la \\nUniversidad de California, Riverside, informa que SIDM puede explicar \\nsimultáneamente dos acertijos astrofísicos en extremos opuestos. \" El primero \\nes un halo de materia oscura de alta densidad en una galaxia elíptica masiva \", \\ndijo Yu. \" El halo fue detectado mediante observaciones de fuertes lentes \\ngravitacionales, y su densidad es tan alta que es extremadamente improbable en \\nla teoría predominante de la materia oscura fría.

Además, los impactos de los \\ncometas que contienen hielo probablemente contribuyeron significativamente a la \\ncantidad de agua en nuestra Tierra, formando sus mares. Este hielo también \\ncontiene átomos de carbono, hidrógeno, oxígeno y nitrógeno que son importantes \\nen la formación de los componentes moleculares de la vida. Sin embargo, nunca antes se había cartografiado en detalle el hielo de los \\ndiscos de formación de planetas, esto se debe a que los telescopios terrestres \\nse ven obstaculizados por nuestra atmósfera que contiene agua y a que otros \\ntelescopios espaciales no eran lo suficientemente grandes para detectar y \\nresolver objetivos tan débiles.

Mather is a Senior Astrophysicist in the Observational Cosmology Laboratory at NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center. His research centers on infrared astronomy and cosmology. As an\\xa0NRC postdoctoral fellow at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (New York City), he led the proposal efforts for the Cosmic Background Explorer (74-76), and came to GSFC to be the Study Scientist (76-88), Project Scientist (88-98), and also the Principal Investigator for the Far IR Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on COBE. He showed that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a blackbody spectrum within 50 ppm. As Senior Project Scientist (95-present) for the James Webb Space Telescope, he leads the science team, and represents scientific interests within the project management. He has served on advisory and working groups for the National Academy of Sciences, NASA, and the NSF (for the ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, and for the CARA, the Center for Astrophysical Research in the Antarctic). He has received many awards including the Nobel Prize in Physics, 2006, for his precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation using the COBE satellite.

Menu Home Blog Index About What is NLG Publications Resources University Book Contact other What LLMs cannot do Dec 11, 2023 ehudreiter I’ve recently been reading papers on limitations on what LLMs can do (some of which were suggested to me in response to a request on Twitter; my thanks to everyone who responded!).  There are some really interesting papers out there, all of which emphasise the core message that LLMs do not “think” like people do.  We need to understand what LLMs can and cannot do on their own terms, and not treat them like pseudo-humans. Anyways, since other people seem interested in the topic, I thought I’d mention a few of the more interesting papers I have looked at. Stochastic Parrots The classic paper on Stochastic Parrots by Bender et al is quite abstract, but makes some excellent general points about language models, such as the below quote.  Well worth reading! Contrary to how it may seem when we observe its output, an LM is a system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot. Bender et al 2021. On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? Proc of FaaCT. Children vs LLMs Yiu et al 2023 is a really interesting paper on stuff that children can do but LLMs cannot.  Again its well worth reading.  One thing that particularly struck me was a discussion of the “blicket detector task”, where young children are asked to figure out which combinations of objects will make a machine light up and play music.  Yiu et al point out that children do this task much better than language models LLMs produce the correct text in cases such as causal vignettes, in which the patterns are available in the training data, but often fail when they are asked to make inferences that involve novel events or relations in human thought (e.g., Binz & Schulz, 2023; Mahowald et al., 2023), sometimes even when these involve superficially slight changes to the training data (e.g., Ullman, 2023). Yiu et al (2023). Transmission Versus Truth, Imitation Versus Innovation: What Children Can Do That Large Language and Language and-Vision Models Cannot (Yet). Perspectives on Psychological Science What I found especially interesting was a comment later in the paper that sometimes LLMS could solve a blicket problem by finding the solution in a published psychology research paper.  Ie, children solve blicket problems by reasoning about the task; LLMs solve blicket problems by searching for published solutions which are available on the internet. Two very different approaches to problem-solving!  And make sense if we think that humans are good at reasoning but poor at extracting solutions from terabytes of internet content, while LLMs struggle with many types of reasoning but are superb at extracting relevant content from the Internet? Embers of Autoregression McCoy et al 2023 is a fascinating paper which points out that LLMs do better at high-probability tasks with high-probability inputs and outputs.  I was especially struck by their example of asking GPT4 to count the letters in a token; they showed that GPT was much more likely to give the correct answer for “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii” than for “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii”.  This is because “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii” has 30 letters and “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii” has 29 letters, and “30” is a much more common token than “29” on the internet. This seems bizarre if we assume that the “count the letters” task is solved by the kind of counting algorithm that a person would use.  But of course GPT does not think like a person!  McCoy et al give many other thought-provoking examples, which make it clear that we cannot predict GPTs behaviour by extrapolating from our experiences with human problem-solving. Our experiments highlight two scenarios where AI practitioners should be careful about using LLMs. First, we have shown that LLMs perform worse on rare tasks than on common ones, so we should be cautious about applying them to tasks that are rare in pretraining data. Second, we have shown that LLMs perform worse on examples with low-probability answers than ones with high-probability answers, so we should be careful about using LLMs in situations where they might need to produce low-probability text. McCoy et al 2023. Embers of Autoregression: Understanding Large Language Models Through the Problem They are Trained to Solve.  Arxiv GAIA Benchmark Mialon et al 2023 propose a new benchmark, GAIA, which is specifically designed around real-world test cases which are relatively easy for humans but hard for LLMs.  For example Where were the Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov in Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper eventually deposited? Just give me the city name without abbreviations. Mialon et al 2023. GAIA: A Benchmark for General AI Assistants.  Arxiv Human can easily answer this because a few minutes of web search will reveal that the title of Nedoshivina 2010 is “A catalogue of the type specimens of the tortricidae described by V.I. Kuznetsov from Vietnam and deposited in the Zoological Institute, St. Petersburg.”  However LLMs struggle to answer this question. The goal of the paper is to propose a new way to evaluate LLMs, but GAIA also gives insights on tasks which are hard for LLMs. Final Thoughts The overall message of all of the above papers is that LLMs in no sense “think” like people do.  Which is exciting, because it means that human+LLM teams should be able to do things which humans alone (or indeed LLMs alone) cannot do!  And I’ve certainly seen many times (including in medical contexts) that human+LLM combo can do a better job than human (or LLM) on its own. I dont think this point is controversial, but it seems to often be ignored in practice, not least when people start talking about LLMs being “human-like” or indeed “superhuman”.  We need to stop comparing LLMs to humans, and instead understand and evaluate what they can and cannot do, without assuming that their abilities in any way correlate with human abilities.

The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

Also see my book on NLG. Menu Home Blog Index About What is NLG Publications Resources University Book Contact other What LLMs cannot\\xa0do Dec 11, 2023 ehudreiter I’ve recently been reading papers on limitations on what LLMs can do (some of which were suggested to me in response to a request on Twitter; my thanks to everyone who responded!).  There are some really interesting papers out there, all of which emphasise the core message that LLMs do not “think” like people do.  We need to understand what LLMs can and cannot do on their own terms, and not treat them like pseudo-humans. Anyways, since other people seem interested in the topic, I thought I’d mention a few of the more interesting papers I have looked at. Stochastic Parrots The classic paper on Stochastic Parrots by Bender et al is quite abstract, but makes some excellent general points about language models, such as the below quote.  Well worth reading! Contrary to how it may seem when we observe its output, an LM is a system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot. Bender et al 2021. On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? Proc of FaaCT. Children vs LLMs Yiu et al 2023 is a really interesting paper on stuff that children can do but LLMs cannot.  Again its well worth reading.  One thing that particularly struck me was a discussion of the “blicket detector task”, where young children are asked to figure out which combinations of objects will make a machine light up and play music.  Yiu et al point out that children do this task much better than language models LLMs produce the correct text in cases such as causal vignettes, in which the patterns are available in the training data, but often fail when they are asked to make inferences that involve novel events or relations in human thought (e.g., Binz & Schulz, 2023; Mahowald et al., 2023), sometimes even when these involve superficially slight changes to the training data (e.g., Ullman, 2023). Yiu et al (2023). Transmission Versus Truth, Imitation Versus Innovation: What Children Can Do That Large Language and Language and-Vision Models Cannot (Yet). Perspectives on Psychological Science What I found especially interesting was a comment later in the paper that sometimes LLMS could solve a blicket problem by finding the solution in a published psychology research paper.  Ie, children solve blicket problems by reasoning about the task; LLMs solve blicket problems by searching for published solutions which are available on the internet. Two very different approaches to problem-solving!  And make sense if we think that humans are good at reasoning but poor at extracting solutions from terabytes of internet content, while LLMs struggle with many types of reasoning but are superb at extracting relevant content from the Internet? Embers of Autoregression McCoy et al 2023 is a fascinating paper which points out that LLMs do better at high-probability tasks with high-probability inputs and outputs.  I was especially struck by their example of asking GPT4 to count the letters in a token; they showed that GPT was much more likely to give the correct answer for “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii” than for “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii”.  This is because “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii” has 30 letters and “iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii” has 29 letters, and “30” is a much more common token than “29” on the internet. This seems bizarre if we assume that the “count the letters” task is solved by the kind of counting algorithm that a person would use.  But of course GPT does not think like a person!  McCoy et al give many other thought-provoking examples, which make it clear that we cannot predict GPTs behaviour by extrapolating from our experiences with human problem-solving. Our experiments highlight two scenarios where AI practitioners should be careful about using LLMs. First, we have shown that LLMs perform worse on rare tasks than on common ones, so we should be cautious about applying them to tasks that are rare in pretraining data. Second, we have shown that LLMs perform worse on examples with low-probability answers than ones with high-probability answers, so we should be careful about using LLMs in situations where they might need to produce low-probability text. McCoy et al 2023. Embers of Autoregression: Understanding Large Language Models Through the Problem They are Trained to Solve.  Arxiv GAIA Benchmark Mialon et al 2023 propose a new benchmark, GAIA, which is specifically designed around real-world test cases which are relatively easy for humans but hard for LLMs.  For example Where were the Vietnamese specimens described by Kuznetzov in Nedoshivina’s 2010 paper eventually deposited? Just give me the city name without abbreviations. Mialon et al 2023. GAIA: A Benchmark for General AI Assistants.  Arxiv Human can easily answer this because a few minutes of web search will reveal that the title of Nedoshivina 2010 is “A catalogue of the type specimens of the tortricidae described by V.I. Kuznetsov from Vietnam and deposited in the Zoological Institute, St. Petersburg.”  However LLMs struggle to answer this question. The goal of the paper is to propose a new way to evaluate LLMs, but GAIA also gives insights on tasks which are hard for LLMs. Final Thoughts The overall message of all of the above papers is that LLMs in no sense “think” like people do.  Which is exciting, because it means that human+LLM teams should be able to do things which humans alone (or indeed LLMs alone) cannot do!  And I’ve certainly seen many times (including in medical contexts) that human+LLM combo can do a better job than human (or LLM) on its own. I dont think this point is controversial, but it seems to often be ignored in practice, not least when people start talking about LLMs being “human-like” or indeed “superhuman”.  We need to stop comparing LLMs to humans, and instead understand and evaluate what they can and cannot do, without assuming that their abilities in any way correlate with human abilities.

GAIA 3 None Here\\'s a fun riddle that I think you\\'ll enjoy.\\n\\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected. GAIA 3 None My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother\\'s daughter, and his daughter\\'s family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma\\'s sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma\\'s brother\\'s daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don\\'t eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.

GAIA Louvrier None You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count\\'s advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\\n\\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It\\'s a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\\n\\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

GAIA 6 None Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host\\'s coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob\\'s guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins.

The city of Amsterdam had previously bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games . Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn Antwerp in Belgium for the 1920 Games and Pierre de Coubertin 's Paris for the 1924 Games . The only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was Los Angeles , which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics , the United States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games. The committee reported a total cost of US$ 1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million, giving a negligible loss of US$18,000, which was a considerable improvement over the 1924 Games. [ 2 ] The United States won the most gold and medals overall. Host city selection [ edit ] Dutch nobleman Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as the host city for the Summer Olympic Games in 1912, even before the Netherlands Olympic Committee was established. The Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 due to World War I . In 1919, the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support for the nomination of Antwerp as host city for the 1920 Summer Olympics . In 1921, Paris was selected for the 1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 2 June 1921. Los Angeles ' bid for the 1928 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful in 1922 and again in 1923. [ 3 ] The city was eventually selected as host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics , being the only bidder for that year. [ 4 ] : p.915 Highlights [ edit ] This section contains a list of miscellaneous information . Please relocate any relevant information into other sections or articles. ( February 2025 ) These were the first Olympics to be organized under the IOC presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour . A symbolic fire was lit for the first time during the Olympics, a tradition that continues today. [ 5 ] The first Olympic flame and torch relay, however, would not take place until the 1936 Summer Olympics . For the first time, the parade of nations started with Greece , which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host country, a tradition that has continued ever since. The events were entirely funded through private donations with the government of the host nation providing no financial support for the first time. [ 6 ] The Games were officially opened by Prince Hendrik , consort of Queen Wilhelmina , who had authorized her husband to deputize for her. [ 4 ] : p.294 The Queen was unable to attend the opening ceremony as she was on holiday in Norway and did not want to disrupt her trip. [ 7 ] This was the second time a head of state had not personally officiated at an Olympic opening ceremony (the first occasion being the 1904 Games in St. Louis , Missouri , which were officially opened by David R. Francis , the Mayor of St. Louis). The Queen had initially refused to appear at either the opening or closing ceremony; it is thought that she objected to the Netherlands hosting the 1928 Games as she considered the Olympics a demonstration of paganism. [ 8 ] However, she returned from Norway before the conclusion of the Games, to be present at the closing ceremony, [ 9 ] and she presented the first prizes at the prize distribution which was held immediately beforehand. [ 4 ] : p.913 The American company Coca-Cola made its first appearance as an official sponsor of the Olympic Games, remaining the oldest Olympic sponsor to this day. [ 10 ] Many cars were expected for the Games, but Amsterdam had at most 2,000 single-car parking spaces. Consequently, several new parking sites were provided, and a special parking symbol was launched to show foreign visitors where they could park. The white P on a blue background was to become the international traffic sign for parking, which is still used today. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] These Games were the first to bear the name \"Summer Olympic Games\", to distinguish them from the Winter Olympic Games (held since 1924). These Games were the first to feature a fixed schedule of sixteen days, which is still followed since 1984. In previous Olympics, competition had been stretched out over several months. Athletics events were held on a 400-meter track, later becoming the standard for athletics tracks. Germany returned to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1912, after being banned from the 1920 and 1924 Games due to its role in World War I . The German team immediately finished second in the 1928 medal count. South American football made a definite breakthrough, as Uruguay retained its title by defeating Argentina . India took its first ever gold medal in field hockey , beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport. Athlete highlights [ edit ] Paavo Nurmi of Finland won his ninth, and final, gold medal in the 10,000 m race . Canadian athlete Percy Williams exceeded expectations by winning both the 100 m and 200 m sprint events. Crown Prince Olav , who would later become King of Norway, won a gold medal in the 6 meter sailing event. Pat O'Callaghan won the first ever medal for a newly independent Ireland , taking gold in the hammer throw . Mikio Oda of Japan won the triple jump event with a result of 15.21 m (49 ft 10.82 in), becoming the first gold medalist from an Asian country. Betty Robinson of the USA won the women's 100 metres in a world record time of 12.2 seconds. She was still just 16 years of age at the time. Algerian-born marathon runner Boughera El Ouafi won a gold medal for France in the men's marathon . Johnny Weissmuller , who later appeared in several Tarzan movies, won two gold medals in swimming : an individual gold in the men's 100 m freestyle , and a team gold in the men's 4 × 200 m freestyle relay . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Sports [ edit ] During the 1928 Summer Olympics, there were 14 sports, 20 disciplines and 109 events in the tournament. In parentheses is the number of events per discipline. [ 4 ] : pp.973–985 Aquatics Diving (4) Swimming (11) Water polo (1) Athletics (27) Boxing (8) Cycling Road (2) Track (4) Equestrian Dressage (2) Eventing (2) Show jumping (2) Fencing (7) Field hockey (1) Football (1) Gymnastics (8) Modern pentathlon (1) Rowing (7) Sailing (3) Weightlifting (5) Wrestling Freestyle (7) Greco-Roman (6) Women's athletics and team gymnastics debuted at these Olympics, [ 15 ] in spite of criticism. Five women's athletics events were added: 100 meters, 800 meters, high jump, discus, and 400 meter hurdles. In protest of the limited number of events, British women athletes, boycotted the Games. [ 16 ] Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female Olympic track and field champion. Reports that the 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated. As a result, the IOC decided that women were too frail for long-distance running, and women's Olympic running events were limited to 200 meters until the 1960s. [ 17 ] Tennis disappeared from the program until it reappeared in 1968 as a demonstration sport . Demonstration sports [ edit ] Kaatsen (not considered official by the IOC) [ 18 ] Korfball Lacrosse These Games also included art competitions in five categories: architecture, painting, sculpture, literature, and music. [ 6 ] However, the IOC no longer considers these to be official medal events, so the medals awarded are not included in today's Olympic medal counts. [ 19 ] Venues [ edit ] The Olympisch Stadion in 1928 Fourteen sports venues were used for the 1928 Summer Olympics. The Swim Stadium was demolished in 1929. [ 4 ] : p.193 The Het Kasteel football stadium was renovated in 1998–99. The Monnikenhuize stadium was demolished in 1950. The Schermzaal sports hall has also been demolished. The Olympic Stadium was renovated between 1996 and 2000, and is still in use. The Old Stadion was demolished in 1929 and replaced with housing in the Amsterdam area. Venue Sports Capacity Ref.

[ a ] Participating nations [ edit ] Participants Number of athletes A total of 46 nations were represented at the Amsterdam Games. Malta , Panama , and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe ) competed at the Olympic Games for the first time. Germany returned after having been banned in 1920 and 1924. [ 23 ] The nations that participated in the previous games in Paris 1924 but were absent in Amsterdam 1928 were Brazil and Ecuador . At the time, Australia , New Zealand , Canada , South Africa and Ireland were all dominions of the British Empire . India and Rhodesia were also a part of the British Empire, but were not dominions. For other sovereign states (i.e. United States, France, Argentina, Japan, etc) and the international community as a whole (i.e League of Nations ) the term dominion , used internally in the British Empire, was very ambiguous, meaning \"something between a colony and state\". It was only years later with the Statute of Westminster 1931 that this ambiguity would be dispelled. Philippines was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States . Participating National Olympic Committees Argentina (81 athletes) Australia (18) Austria (73) Belgium (186) Bulgaria (5) Canada (69) Chile (38) Cuba (1) Czechoslovakia (70) Denmark (91) Estonia (20) Egypt (32) Finland (69) France (255) Germany (296) Great Britain (232) Greece (23) Haiti (2) Hungary (109) India (21) Ireland (27) Italy (174) Japan (43) Latvia (14) Lithuania (12) Luxembourg (46) Malta (9) Mexico (30) Monaco (7) Netherlands (264) (host) New Zealand (10) Norway (52) Panama (1) Philippines (4) Poland (93) Portugal (31) Rhodesia (2) Romania (29) South Africa (24) Spain (80) Switzerland (133) Sweden (100) Turkey (31) United States (280) Uruguay (22) Yugoslavia (34) Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees [ edit ] Country Athletes Germany 296 United States 280 Netherlands 264 France 255 Great Britain 232 Belgium 186 Italy 174 Switzerland 133 Hungary 109 Sweden 100 Poland 93 Denmark 91 Argentina 81 Spain 80 Austria 73 Czechoslovakia 70 Canada 69 Finland 69 Norway 52 Luxembourg 46 Japan 43 Chile 38 Yugoslavia 34 Egypt 32 Portugal 31 Turkey 31 Mexico 30 Romania 29 Ireland 27 South Africa 24 Greece 23 Uruguay 22 India 21 Estonia 20 Australia 18 Latvia 14 Lithuania 12 New Zealand 10 Malta 9 Monaco 7 Bulgaria 5 Philippines 4 Haiti 2 Rhodesia 2 Cuba 1 Panama 1 Total 2,883 Medal count [ edit ] Main articles: 1928 Summer Olympics medal table and List of 1928 Summer Olympics medal winners These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1928 Games.

The IOC used a different poster, with the German text Olympische Spiele , and an athlete partly covered in the Dutch national flag , holding a peace leaf in his hand. The poster was made for a German book about the Amsterdam Olympics. [ 24 ] Last surviving competitor [ edit ] The last living competitor of the 1928 Summer Olympics was Carla Marangoni , a member of the silver medal-winning Italian gymnastic team who had been twelve years old during the Olympics. Marangoni died 18 January 2018, at the age of 102 as the oldest living Olympic medalist at the time of her death.

This edition of the Games was notable for its inclusivity, featuring an expanded program for women, enabled by participation from 2,883 athletes from 46 countries, with nearly 10 percent being female. Germany made its return to the Olympics after being banned in 1920, reflecting a gradual easing of post-World War I tensions. The competition spanned 109 events across sixteen sports, with the United States dominating the medal tally, securing 56 medals in total. The Games also witnessed remarkable individual performances, such as those by swimmer Johnny Weissmuller and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi. Furthermore, this event was the first to be officially termed the \"Summer Olympics,\" setting it apart from that year's Winter Games. The event fostered a sense of international goodwill, evidenced by record attendance and diverse representation among medal-winning countries, which underlined the Olympics' burgeoning global appeal. The legacy of the 1928 Games includes not only its sporting achievements but also its role in establishing a financial model for future Olympic hosts and enhancing the ritualistic elements of the Olympic experience.

Representatives from Greece led the parade of nations, while the host country entered the stadium last. These Games witnessed an expanded program of events for women and were also the only Summer Games held in a country other than the one hosting that year’s Winter Games until 1948, when St. Moritz, Switzerland, hosted the Winter Games and London, England, hosted the Summer Games. The 1928 Summer Games were also noteworthy for their broad range of medal-winning nationalities: Athletes from twenty-eight countries were awarded gold medals, while five other countries captured at least one silver or bronze medal. Amsterdam had sought to host the 1920 and 1924 Games, but the cities of Antwerp and Paris were chosen first. After competing with Los Angeles for the next opportunity to host, Amsterdam’s selection as host city was announced in 1923 by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), after which the Netherlands Olympic Committee set about the task of preparing for the Games. Of the sixty-two countries invited, forty-six accepted and sent 2,883 athletes, of whom almost 10 percent were female. Germany was invited to return to the Games for the first time since having been banned from Olympic competition in 1920. Concurrent with the Games were art competitions, sports congresses, and reports on physiological research, including the first gathering of a sports medicine group. The Games Dutch nobleman Prince Hendrik, representing Queen Wilhelmina, officially opened the 1928 Summer Olympics. Dutch athlete Henri Denis took the Olympic Oath. The Amsterdam Olympics were the first Summer Games to initiate symbolic practices that became rituals performed at all later Olympic Games. These included the lighting of the Olympic flame at the Olympic stadium, the selection of Greece as the first country in the parade of nations, with the host country as the final entrant into the stadium, and a public releasing of doves. It was in the marketing for the 1928 Summer Olympics that posters first displayed the Olympic design of five interlocking rings. These Games were also the first to be officially designated the “Summer” Olympics, as well as the first to be conducted in a separate country from the same year’s Winter Games. The 1928 Summer Games consisted of 109 competitions in sixteen sports, plus three demonstration sports. Early competition in football and field hockey occurred in May and June, with the majority of the competition taking place over the final two to three weeks of the Games. Women’s events were extended to include track-and-field competitions and gymnastics, despite the various objections of de Coubertin and the Vatican. Notable Performances Official attendance at the Games’ events amounted to 251,747 spectators, over half of whom were believed to have come for the football (soccer) competition alone. Swiss gymnasts Georges Miez and Hermann Hänggi each won four medals, totaling five gold medals between them. Paavo Nurmi of Finland won the last of his nine gold medals in the 10,000-meter race, along with two silver medals. India initiated a streak of six consecutive Olympic gold medal performances in field hockey by winning its initial gold medal at the 1928 Summer Games. American swimmer and future film star Johnny Weissmuller won gold medals in the 100-meter freestyle swim and the 4 × 200-meter relay events. Then a major general, Douglas MacArthur served as president of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) during these Games and led the American team presence. In all, athletes from five continents won gold medals, and the Games featured eleven multiple gold medal winners, led by Swiss gymnast George Miez, who received three. The 1928 Summer Games also featured the first expanded Olympic program for women, offering competition in gymnastics and five track-and-field events. However, German runner Lina Radke’s visible exhaustion after winning the 800-meter race contributed to the future limiting of women’s Olympic races to distances of 200 meters or less until 1960. Summary of Competition The United States won fifty-six total medals, including twenty-two gold medals, easily outdistancing Germany’s thirty-one medals and ten gold medals. Finland and Sweden each totaled twenty-five medals. The Dutch won nineteen medals, six of which were gold. In men’s athletics, British and Canadian competitors tended to dominate the short distances, while the Finns performed better in longer races. Americans were strongest in relays and field events. American and Canadian women took eight of the fifteen track-and-field medals. Italian and Argentine athletes excelled at boxing, while the Danes and Dutch took cycling honors. American divers received gold medals in the four diving events, winning nine of the twelve overall medals. French and Italian athletes won almost half of the fencing medals. Swiss male gymnasts won gold medals in five of their sport’s seven events, while the Dutch women’s gymnastics team won a gold medal in their discipline. Uruguay received a gold medal in football, defeating Argentina in a second game after the first had ended in a tie. Due to the rising popularity of Olympic competition in this sport and conflicts between the international football group Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the Olympic concept of amateurism, FIFA formed its own World Cup tournament for 1930. That event was hosted by Uruguay, who defeated Argentina again. With football removed from the program of events at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games, Olympic football became secondary to the World Cup in the eyes of FIFA fans. India won a gold medal in field hockey without allowing any of its competitors to score a goal, while northern European countries completely dominated the sailing competition. American swimmers, both men and women, won eleven of the thirty-three total medals in their events, including six gold medals. Finnish and Swedish athletes were preeminent in both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling. Impact The Summer Games of 1928 further reinforced the universal appeal of the Games with their record attendance, new traditions in the opening ceremonies, and expanded women’s competitions. Outstanding individual and team performances ushered in an era of Olympic fame after the IOC presidency of de Coubertin. As the Games welcomed Germany’s return, political issues that would embroil the Games in subsequent years were minimized, likely due to the year’s overall prosperity and efforts to communicate international goodwill. The Amsterdam Games provided a financial model that future host countries would study as they prepared for the Games. The Coca-Cola Company, a frequent Olympic sponsor, was first involved in the financing of the Olympic Games at the 1928 Summer Games. Bibliography Guttman, Allen.

The city of Amsterdam had previously bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games . Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn Antwerp in Belgium for the 1920 Games and Pierre de Coubertin \\'s Paris for the 1924 Games . The only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was Los Angeles , which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics , the United States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games. The committee reported a total cost of US$ 1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million, giving a negligible loss of US$18,000, which was a considerable improvement over the 1924 Games. [ 2 ] The United States won the most gold and medals overall. Host city selection [ edit ] Dutch nobleman Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as the host city for the Summer Olympic Games in 1912, even before the Netherlands Olympic Committee was established. The Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 due to World War\\xa0I . In 1919, the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support for the nomination of Antwerp as host city for the 1920 Summer Olympics . In 1921, Paris was selected for the 1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 2\\xa0June 1921. Los Angeles \\' bid for the 1928 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful in 1922 and again in 1923. [ 3 ] The city was eventually selected as host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics , being the only bidder for that year. [ 4 ] :\\u200ap.915 Highlights [ edit ] This section contains a list of miscellaneous information . Please relocate any relevant information into other sections or articles. ( February 2025 ) These were the first Olympics to be organized under the IOC presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour . A symbolic fire was lit for the first time during the Olympics, a tradition that continues today. [ 5 ] The first Olympic flame and torch relay, however, would not take place until the 1936 Summer Olympics . For the first time, the parade of nations started with Greece , which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host country, a tradition that has continued ever since. The events were entirely funded through private donations with the government of the host nation providing no financial support for the first time. [ 6 ] The Games were officially opened by Prince Hendrik , consort of Queen Wilhelmina , who had authorized her husband to deputize for her. [ 4 ] :\\u200ap.294 The Queen was unable to attend the opening ceremony as she was on holiday in Norway and did not want to disrupt her trip. [ 7 ] This was the second time a head of state had not personally officiated at an Olympic opening ceremony (the first occasion being the 1904 Games in St.\\xa0Louis , Missouri , which were officially opened by David R. Francis , the Mayor of St.\\xa0Louis). The Queen had initially refused to appear at either the opening or closing ceremony; it is thought that she objected to the Netherlands hosting the 1928 Games as she considered the Olympics a demonstration of paganism. [ 8 ] However, she returned from Norway before the conclusion of the Games, to be present at the closing ceremony, [ 9 ] and she presented the first prizes at the prize distribution which was held immediately beforehand. [ 4 ] :\\u200ap.913 The American company Coca-Cola made its first appearance as an official sponsor of the Olympic Games, remaining the oldest Olympic sponsor to this day. [ 10 ] Many cars were expected for the Games, but Amsterdam had at most 2,000 single-car parking spaces. Consequently, several new parking sites were provided, and a special parking symbol was launched to show foreign visitors where they could park. The white P on a blue background was to become the international traffic sign for parking, which is still used today. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] These Games were the first to bear the name \"Summer Olympic Games\", to distinguish them from the Winter Olympic Games (held since 1924). These Games were the first to feature a fixed schedule of sixteen days, which is still followed since 1984. In previous Olympics, competition had been stretched out over several months. Athletics events were held on a 400-meter track, later becoming the standard for athletics tracks. Germany returned to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1912, after being banned from the 1920 and 1924 Games due to its role in World War I . The German team immediately finished second in the 1928 medal count. South American football made a definite breakthrough, as Uruguay retained its title by defeating Argentina . India took its first ever gold medal in field hockey , beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport. Athlete highlights [ edit ] Paavo Nurmi of Finland won his ninth, and final, gold medal in the 10,000\\xa0m race . Canadian athlete Percy Williams exceeded expectations by winning both the 100\\xa0m and 200\\xa0m sprint events. Crown Prince Olav , who would later become King of Norway, won a gold medal in the 6\\xa0meter sailing event. Pat O\\'Callaghan won the first ever medal for a newly independent Ireland , taking gold in the hammer throw . Mikio Oda of Japan won the triple jump event with a result of 15.21\\xa0m (49\\xa0ft 10.82\\xa0in), becoming the first gold medalist from an Asian country. Betty Robinson of the USA won the women\\'s 100 metres in a world record time of 12.2 seconds. She was still just 16 years of age at the time. Algerian-born marathon runner Boughera El Ouafi won a gold medal for France in the men\\'s marathon . Johnny Weissmuller , who later appeared in several Tarzan movies, won two gold medals in swimming : an individual gold in the men\\'s 100\\xa0m freestyle , and a team gold in the men\\'s 4\\xa0×\\xa0200\\xa0m freestyle relay . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Sports [ edit ] During the 1928 Summer Olympics, there were 14 sports, 20 disciplines and 109 events in the tournament. In parentheses is the number of events per discipline.

Five women\\'s athletics events were added: 100 meters, 800 meters, high jump, discus, and 400 meter hurdles. In protest of the limited number of events, British women athletes, boycotted the Games. [ 16 ] Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female Olympic track and field champion. Reports that the 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated. As a result, the IOC decided that women were too frail for long-distance running, and women\\'s Olympic running events were limited to 200 meters until the 1960s. [ 17 ] Tennis disappeared from the program until it reappeared in 1968 as a demonstration sport .

[ 6 ] However, the IOC no longer considers these to be official medal events, so the medals awarded are not included in today\\'s Olympic medal counts.

[ a ] Participating nations [ edit ] Participants Number of athletes A total of 46 nations were represented at the Amsterdam Games. Malta , Panama , and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe ) competed at the Olympic Games for the first time. Germany returned after having been banned in 1920 and 1924. [ 23 ] The nations that participated in the previous games in Paris 1924 but were absent in Amsterdam 1928 were Brazil and Ecuador . At the time, Australia , New Zealand , Canada , South Africa and Ireland were all dominions of the British Empire . India and Rhodesia were also a part of the British Empire, but were not dominions. For other sovereign states (i.e.\\xa0United States,\\xa0France,\\xa0Argentina,\\xa0Japan, etc) and the international community as a whole (i.e League of Nations ) the term dominion , used internally in the British Empire, was very ambiguous, meaning \"something between a colony and state\". It was only years later with the Statute of Westminster 1931 that this ambiguity would be dispelled. Philippines was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States .

The IOC used a different poster, with the German text Olympische Spiele , and an athlete partly covered in the Dutch national flag , holding a peace leaf in his hand. The poster was made for a German book about the Amsterdam Olympics. [ 24 ] Last surviving competitor [ edit ] The last living competitor of the 1928 Summer Olympics was Carla Marangoni , a member of the silver medal-winning Italian gymnastic team who had been twelve years old during the Olympics. Marangoni died 18 January 2018, at the age of 102 as the oldest living Olympic medalist at the time of her death.

Search EBSCOhost Research Starters Home Olympic Games of 1928 (Summer) The 1928 Summer Olympics, held in Amsterdam, marked a significant moment in Olympic history as it introduced key traditions that would shape future Games, including the lighting of the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony. This edition of the Games was notable for its inclusivity, featuring an expanded program for women, enabled by participation from 2,883 athletes from 46 countries, with nearly 10 percent being female. Germany made its return to the Olympics after being banned in 1920, reflecting a gradual easing of post-World War I tensions. The competition spanned 109 events across sixteen sports, with the United States dominating the medal tally, securing 56 medals in total. The Games also witnessed remarkable individual performances, such as those by swimmer Johnny Weissmuller and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi. Furthermore, this event was the first to be officially termed the \"Summer Olympics,\" setting it apart from that year\\'s Winter Games. The event fostered a sense of international goodwill, evidenced by record attendance and diverse representation among medal-winning countries, which underlined the Olympics\\' burgeoning global appeal. The legacy of the 1928 Games includes not only its sporting achievements but also its role in establishing a financial model for future Olympic hosts and enhancing the ritualistic elements of the Olympic experience.

Representatives from Greece led the parade of nations, while the host country entered the stadium last. These Games witnessed an expanded program of events for women and were also the only Summer Games held in a country other than the one hosting that year’s Winter Games until 1948, when St. Moritz, Switzerland, hosted the Winter Games and London, England, hosted the Summer Games. The 1928 Summer Games were also noteworthy for their broad range of medal-winning nationalities: Athletes from twenty-eight countries were awarded gold medals, while five other countries captured at least one silver or bronze medal. Amsterdam had sought to host the 1920 and 1924 Games, but the cities of Antwerp and Paris were chosen first. After competing with Los Angeles for the next opportunity to host, Amsterdam’s selection as host city was announced in 1923 by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), after which the Netherlands Olympic Committee set about the task of preparing for the Games. Of the sixty-two countries invited, forty-six accepted and sent 2,883 athletes, of whom almost 10 percent were female. Germany was invited to return to the Games for the first time since having been banned from Olympic competition in 1920. Concurrent with the Games were art competitions, sports congresses, and reports on physiological research, including the first gathering of a sports medicine group. The Games Dutch nobleman Prince Hendrik, representing Queen Wilhelmina, officially opened the 1928 Summer Olympics. Dutch athlete Henri Denis took the Olympic Oath. The Amsterdam Olympics were the first Summer Games to initiate symbolic practices that became rituals performed at all later Olympic Games. These included the lighting of the Olympic flame at the Olympic stadium, the selection of Greece as the first country in the parade of nations, with the host country as the final entrant into the stadium, and a public releasing of doves. It was in the marketing for the 1928 Summer Olympics that posters first displayed the Olympic design of five interlocking rings. These Games were also the first to be officially designated the “Summer” Olympics, as well as the first to be conducted in a separate country from the same year’s Winter Games. The 1928 Summer Games consisted of 109 competitions in sixteen sports, plus three demonstration sports. Early competition in football and field hockey occurred in May and June, with the majority of the competition taking place over the final two to three weeks of the Games. Women’s events were extended to include track-and-field competitions and gymnastics, despite the various objections of de Coubertin and the Vatican. Notable Performances Official attendance at the Games’ events amounted to 251,747 spectators, over half of whom were believed to have come for the football (soccer) competition alone. Swiss gymnasts Georges Miez and Hermann Hänggi each won four medals, totaling five gold medals between them. Paavo Nurmi of Finland won the last of his nine gold medals in the 10,000-meter race, along with two silver medals. India initiated a streak of six consecutive Olympic gold medal performances in field hockey by winning its initial gold medal at the 1928 Summer Games. American swimmer and future film star Johnny Weissmuller won gold medals in the 100-meter freestyle swim and the 4 × 200-meter relay events. Then a major general, Douglas MacArthur served as president of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) during these Games and led the American team presence. In all, athletes from five continents won gold medals, and the Games featured eleven multiple gold medal winners, led by Swiss gymnast George Miez, who received three. The 1928 Summer Games also featured the first expanded Olympic program for women, offering competition in gymnastics and five track-and-field events. However, German runner Lina Radke’s visible exhaustion after winning the 800-meter race contributed to the future limiting of women’s Olympic races to distances of 200 meters or less until 1960. Summary of Competition The United States won fifty-six total medals, including twenty-two gold medals, easily outdistancing Germany’s thirty-one medals and ten gold medals. Finland and Sweden each totaled twenty-five medals. The Dutch won nineteen medals, six of which were gold. In men’s athletics, British and Canadian competitors tended to dominate the short distances, while the Finns performed better in longer races. Americans were strongest in relays and field events. American and Canadian women took eight of the fifteen track-and-field medals. Italian and Argentine athletes excelled at boxing, while the Danes and Dutch took cycling honors. American divers received gold medals in the four diving events, winning nine of the twelve overall medals. French and Italian athletes won almost half of the fencing medals. Swiss male gymnasts won gold medals in five of their sport’s seven events, while the Dutch women’s gymnastics team won a gold medal in their discipline. Uruguay received a gold medal in football, defeating Argentina in a second game after the first had ended in a tie. Due to the rising popularity of Olympic competition in this sport and conflicts between the international football group Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the Olympic concept of amateurism, FIFA formed its own World Cup tournament for 1930. That event was hosted by Uruguay, who defeated Argentina again. With football removed from the program of events at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games, Olympic football became secondary to the World Cup in the eyes of FIFA fans. India won a gold medal in field hockey without allowing any of its competitors to score a goal, while northern European countries completely dominated the sailing competition. American swimmers, both men and women, won eleven of the thirty-three total medals in their events, including six gold medals. Finnish and Swedish athletes were preeminent in both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling. Impact The Summer Games of 1928 further reinforced the universal appeal of the Games with their record attendance, new traditions in the opening ceremonies, and expanded women’s competitions. Outstanding individual and team performances ushered in an era of Olympic fame after the IOC presidency of de Coubertin. As the Games welcomed Germany’s return, political issues that would embroil the Games in subsequent years were minimized, likely due to the year’s overall prosperity and efforts to communicate international goodwill. The Amsterdam Games provided a financial model that future host countries would study as they prepared for the Games. The Coca-Cola Company, a frequent Olympic sponsor, was first involved in the financing of the Olympic Games at the 1928 Summer Games. Bibliography Guttman, Allen.

The response mentions the names of three individuals, Harry Roberts, John Duddy, and John Witney, who committed the Massacre of Braybrook Street in 1966, which is correct. However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address. The response also does not mention the correct individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, which is Harry Roberts. So the response is mostly incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual.

However, the response also includes additional information about the other perpetrators and the year of the event, which was not requested in the instruction. The instruction specifically asked for the individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, and the response correctly names Harry Roberts, who was born in that year. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but it includes unnecessary additional information. 2023-12-18T19:01:11 2023-12-18T19:01:59 HotpotQA-easy 0 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style David Pear was a NFL football player, that won Super Bowl XV, playing on which team?

No hit, no runs in the first innings \"I'm a little relieved\" Sports Hochi 2025.5.4(日) 06:40 ◆ Pacific League Seibu 4-3 Nippon-Ham (3rd, ES CON FIELD) Nippon-Ham lost a close game against Seibu 3-4 in the 3rd to stop their winning streak at 3. In the 8th inning, Taisho Tamai pitcher (32) made his first appearance for the first time in 576 days since October 5, 2023 against Rakuten (Rakuten Mobile). Hit by Pitch hit runs closer The iron arm, who has pitched in 40 or more games for six consecutive years since 2006, returned to the first team bullpen. There was no time to be emotional. It was his first appearance of the season, and it was only nine days after his promotion. After getting the third out with a grounder to third base, Tamai (pictured) took a sigh and slowly returned to the bench. After a first-team mound in 576 days, he finished with no hit no runs, and reflected, \"For now, it's good that I was able closer at zero. I'm a little relieved.\" There were also moments when he showed his true colors. He threw a pitch inside to Nevin, who had hit a home run, and allowed the only runner on Hit by Pitch. \"That's part of my pitching. It's best to not hit the ball and throw it inside, but I hope I can do that more and more in the future.\" Even after a break, his aggressive pitching style has not changed. Last season, he did not pitch in the first team due to back pain. During the off-season, he also worked on sidearm pitching, and said, \"I realized a lot of things and was able to try a lot of different things, so it was a meaningful year.\" His arm has improved back to a slightly lower position than last season, but that is also part of the process of evolution. Looking ahead, he said, \"My pitching in the future will make me think that it was good that I spent last year in that way.\" The season has just begun. \"I'm in a position where I can't relax. I want to concentrate on each game and prepare well so that I can pitch the way I want to.\" With bullpen getting stronger, he will overturn Manager Shinjo's ranking. (Yamaguchi Yasushi) struck out runner hit runs pitcher The first two are the first two innings of the season, and the second two innings are the first two innings of the season, and the third two innings are the first two innings of the season, and the fourth two innings are the first two innings of the season. I couldn't prevent them from scoring the next run.

However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address.

They compete in the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball , playing the majority of their home games at ES CON Field Hokkaido . The Fighters also host a select number of regional home games in cities across Hokkaidō, including Hakodate , Asahikawa , Kushiro , and Obihiro . The team's name comes from its parent organization, Nippon Ham , a major Japanese food-processing company. Founded in 1946, the Fighters called Tokyo home for 58 years, as co-tenants of the Tokyo Dome and Korakuen Stadium with the Central League 's Yomiuri Giants near the end of their tenure in the capital city. The franchise has won three Japan Series titles, in 1962, 2006, and, most recently, 2016. Team history [ edit ] Senators and Tokyo eras [ edit ] In 1946, Saburo Yokozawa , manager of the Tokyo Senators in 1936–1937 (and later a prominent umpire), looked to revive the franchise and soon founded the new Senators . He assembled a team of ready and able players like Hiroshi Oshita , Shigeya Iijima and Giichiro Shiraki , but as a newly formed team the Senators faced strict fiscal management and resorted to using hand-me-down uniforms from the Hankyu Railway's pre-war team (who would eventually become the modern-day Orix Buffaloes ). Former Japanese statesman Kinkazu Saionji , grandson of the influential Kinmochi Saionji , became the team's owner, and Noboru Oride , borrowing heavily from a Ginza cabaret proprietor, became the team's sponsor. Eventually, trapped by a lack of funds, Yokozawa was forced to resign as the team's manager. For a time, the team was even mockingly nicknamed \"Seito\" (Bluestockings) after a Japanese feminist magazine of the same name . As the Yomiuri Giants ' pet name was \"Kyojin\", baseball personality Soutaro Suzuki thought that other teams should also have pet names like the Giants, and names such as the Osaka Tigers ' alias \"Mouko\" (fierce tiger), the Senators' \"Seito\" and the Pacific 's \"Taihei\" (tranquility) began to be used by the press . However, the other teams rejected the use of these pet names, so they were not fully adopted. On January 7, 1947, the team was sold to the Tokyu Corporation . The Tokyu baseball club was inaugurated into the league, and the team's name became the Tokyu Flyers . At that time Tokyu dominated the Japanese transportation sector, owning several other railway companies, although it was faced with troubles and the possibility of a breakup. Tokyu purchased the team to act as a banner of solidarity for the swelling company, and managing director Hiroshi Okawa assumed ownership of the club. The newly born Flyers, with Hiroshi Oshita becoming one of the most popular players in the league , began to attract many fans, but the team's administration still went into a deficit. With the formation of the National Baseball League drawing nearer, in 1948 the not-yet-affiliated Daiei club , which had played a few exhibition games against the Otsuka Athletics , joined with Tokyu to create the Kyuei Flyers (\"Kyuei\" being a portmanteau of the two companies' names). However, Daiei decided to purchase a separate team, the Kinsei Stars , and after only one year the Flyers reverted to their former name. During the off-season of 1949, the Flyers joined the Pacific League after the former league split. In September 1953, the team completed a new ballpark— Komazawa Stadium —along one of Tokyu's train lines in Setagaya , Tokyo, moving from Bunkyo ward's Korakuen Stadium . The Flyers' wild play on the field eventually earned them the nickname, \"Komazawa's hooligans\". Toei and Nittaku eras [ edit ] On February 1, 1954, Tokyu entrusted the management of the Flyers to the Toei Company , of which Okawa had newly become president. Toei transferred control of the club to a subsidiary company, Toei Kogyo (industrial enterprise). The team's name was changed to the Toei Flyers , and its legal name consequently became the Toei Flyers Baseball Club. This name stuck for nineteen years. In 1961, when Yomiuri Giants manager Shigeru Mizuhara resigned from his position, Okawa attempted to woo him to join his team, bringing him to a bar in Kyoto and calling famous movie producer Koji Shundo to meet with them. Shundo, an old drinking buddy of Mizuhara's, convinced the four-time Japan Series champion manager to join the Flyers, and he solidified a strong relationship with Okawa and Toei Studios. Komazawa Stadium was to be torn down to make way for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics , so in 1962 the Flyers moved their base of operations to Meiji Jingu Stadium in Shinjuku . (At that time, college baseball teams had priority at Meiji Jingu, so during weekends or other times when school games were being played the Flyers had to use Korakuen or another field for their games.)  In the same year, two star aces, Masayuki Dobashi and Yukio Ozaki, blossomed under Mizuhara's coaching and the Flyers captured their first league championship. They would go on to defy odds in the Japan Series and defeat the Hanshin Tigers for their first Japan Series title. This championship would be their only one in the Toei era. The Kokutetsu Swallows jointly occupied Meiji Jingu with the Flyers the following season, and in 1964 the Flyers went back to their old home, Korakuen, also home of the Yomiuri Giants ; both the Fighters and Giants would share a home for the next 39 years. The Flyers assembled a group of powerful sluggers over the next few years—among them: Isao Harimoto , Katsuo Osugi, Inchon Bek , and Shoichi Busujima —but on top of a declining movie industry and the \" Black Mist \" match-fixing scandal that rocked the professional baseball world in 1970 (after which Flyers ace Toshiaki Moriyasu was banned from the game for life), in 1971 Flyers owner Okawa died suddenly. Shigeru Okada , who did not view Okawa favorably, took over Toei after his death. Together with Noboru Goto , company president of Tokyu and loyal friend of Okada (and one who also thought unfavorably of Okawa), Okada let go of the unprofitable team. The team was sold to Akitaka Nishimura of the Nittaku Home real estate enterprise, a common acquaintance of Okada and Goto, on February 7, 1973. The team's name became the Nittaku Home Flyers . Nishimura, in an attempt to inject life back into the unpopular Pacific League, developed seven different uniforms for his team and experimented in every aspect of the team's operation, but the effort failed to produce results. Believing that the Pacific League's chances of survival were grim, Nishimura was on the verge of partnering with the Lotte Orions , who were eyeing a league reunification. When the deal fell through, Nishimura, tired of the baseball establishment, resigned from his leadership position and abandoned the Flyers. Nippon-Ham era [ edit ] On November 19, 1973, meatpacking company Nippon Ham purchased the team, led by owner Yoshinori Okoso. Okoso had bought the team as he was willing to bring them back to prominence when essentially no one wanted them. He loved them to death, so much so that he never held any company meetings when the team was playing, and if where he was at, they were not on TV or radio, he would dispatch employees to go to that game and update him via payphone . The club's name was changed to the Nippon-Ham Fighters , its official name became the Nippon-Ham Baseball Corporation. Osamu Mihara became the team president and Futoshi Nakanishi , Mihara's son-in-law, as its manager. After 27 years, the \"Flyers\" nickname was abandoned. The \"Fighters\" nickname was born from a public appeal by the team's management. A female high school student from Okayama prefecture submitted the winning name, giving the reasoning that \"(former Fighters player) Katsuo Osugi has guts, so he's a fighter.\"  Osugi would be traded to the Yakult Swallows soon after the Fighters were rechristened. The same would be for Zainichi Korean Isao Harimoto , as Nakanishi hated Harimoto for challenging his authority, going nearly as far as trying to release him. This was also because Harimoto was upset that the FIghters sent away Osugi, and that he was the only reason he stuck around. In fact, when the then-Flyers attempted to trade Osugi to the Hanshin Tigers for Yutaka Enatsu (who the Fighters would ironically get later), Harimoto went to the front office and demanded they immediately cancel the trade. However, Okoso did not want to let him go, as Nippon-Ham had a major presence in South Korea, and it did wonders for sales having one of the greatest Koreans play for them, and having traded their other Korean player, Baek In-chun , to the Taiheyo Club Lions in 1974, Okoso was worried Nippon-Ham would completely lose their presence in South Korea. Mihara, however, persisted, and they nearly sent him to the Hanshin Tigers, before the Yomiuri Giants made a convincing last-minute deal to send him there instead. Over the four seasons between 1974 and 1977, the Fighters dwelled at the bottom of the Pacific League, but after improving to finishing in third place for three straight years between 1978 and 1980, manager Keiji Osawa finally led the Fighters to their second Pacific League pennant in 1981. With saves leader Yutaka Enatsu and starter Shigekuni Mashiba (who went 15–0 over the season) forming the heart of the pitching staff, the Fighters shined with offensive sluggers Tony Solaita , Junichi Kashiwabara , and Tommy Cruz . The team that year also featured various important players of smaller stature, like Makoto Shimada and Nobuhiro Takashiro . They would go on to play the Yomiuri Giants in the Japan Series, where the Fighters lost in six games. At the time, the franchise shared Korakuen Stadium with the Giants, so scheduling games throughout the season for both teams posed a problem. League schedulers tried to avoid putting the Fighters and the Giants at Korakuen on the same day, but when they both had home games scheduled, league officials made the implicit decision that the Giants would play during the day and the Fighters during the night. One novel aspect of the Fighters was that they attracted armies of grade-school boys to sit in the outfield stands on weekend games under a \"Young Boys’ Fan Club\" promotion, starting the first organized fan club in Japanese professional baseball. During the 1980s the Fighters hosted many of the Pacific League's leading pitchers, including Isamu Kida (led the P.L. with 22 wins in his rookie year in 1980; won MVP , Rookie of the Year the same year), Mikio Kudō (20 wins in 1982), Hiroshi Tsuno (recorded double-digit win totals in several years throughout the mid-eighties) and Yasumitsu Shibata (three-time All Star; recorded no-hitter in 1990). Yukihiro Nishizaki particularly stood out, recording 15 wins and an ERA under three in each of his first two years (though the Rookie of the Year title eluded him), racking up seven double-digit win seasons over the course of his eleven-year stay with the Fighters and gaining a considerable following from female fans due to his easy-going demeanor. In 1986 shortstop Yukio Tanaka joined the club; he remained with the team for 22 seasons, becoming known as \"Mr. Fighters\". [ 1 ] Tokyo Dome, former ballpark of the Fighters From 1988 until the move to Hokkaidō , the Fighters played their home games in Tokyo Dome , the stadium that replaced their longtime home Korakuen. After the Dome was finished, the pitching dominance of Yukihiro Nishizaki and Yasumitsu Shibata began to emerge. Keiji Osawa came out of retirement to manage the team for a third time in 1993, only to see his team sink to the bottom of the standings; he gained notoriety for kneeling to the fans at the end of that season, begging for their forgiveness. With the Fighters experiencing more managerial troubles in 1996, then-manager Toshiharu Ueda suddenly took a personal leave during a pennant race with the Orix BlueWave , eventually causing the Fighters to fade over the last month of the season. However, new life was born in Tokyo Dome in 1998. Hitters such as Nigel Wilson , Jerry Brooks , Yukio Tanaka , Atsushi Kataoka , Katsuhiro Nishiura and a young Michihiro Ogasawara formed what became known as the Big Bang lineup and subsequently shattered various batting records. They ran away with first place for the first half of the season, but a pitching collapse in the second half caused a fall of historical proportions. The Fighters would ultimately finish in second place to the Seibu Lions . Hokkaido Nippon-Ham era [ edit ] Sapporo Dome in 2004 Sapporo dome Prior to the 2002 season, the idea of moving the Fighters to Sapporo , the capital of Hokkaidō and Japan's fifth largest city, emerged. The Seibu Lions also had preliminary plans to move to the northern metropolis. Tokyo's Fighters fans voiced their opposition to the proposed relocation (though the franchise never drew as many fans as their co-habitual counterparts, the Giants, while playing in the capital), but it was eventually announced that the team would indeed call the Sapporo Dome its new home beginning in 2004. Aiming to build a grassroots relationship with its future fans, the team decided to change its name to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters . At first, with the unhappy Seibu Lions suddenly changing their approval vote, Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe and Seibu owner Yoshiaki Tsutsumi voiced their concerns over the move. They believed that Nippon Ham's choice to move the team would spur a decentralization in Japanese professional baseball, and they threatened that a decrease in the number of teams in the Kantō and Kansai regions should merit a one-league system instead of two. As a matter of fact, the question of reorganizing baseball's league structure eventually became a bigger issue than the sale and renaming of the Kintetsu Buffaloes . The issue eventually settled down, though, and the Fighters' relocation was eventually approved by the league. The response from the people of Hokkaidō was weak, but NPB fans welcomed the move, noting that the Fighters could now be free from the Tokyo Dome's high rent and perpetual second-billing to the Giants. Out of respect for the Tokyo-based Fighters fans, the team decided to schedule a few \"home\" games per season at the Tokyo Dome. After the move finally was complete in 2004, the Fighters signed former-Tigers superstar Tsuyoshi Shinjo , who came back to NPB from MLB after playing with the New York Mets and nearly winning a World Series title with the San Francisco Giants and a revitalized Fernando Seguignol . American manager Trey Hillman led the team to success in his second year on the job, and at the end of the season, the Fighters were in a fierce race with the Chiba Lotte Marines for the final spot in the new P.L. playoff system. With a vital win over the Orix BlueWave on September 24, the newly moved Fighters earned a trip to the postseason, advancing to play Seibu in a three-game series. Though they put up a strong effort against Seibu ace Daisuke Matsuzaka , the Fighters lost the first game of the series 6–5. They took Game 2 by a score of 5–4. In the decisive third game, the Fighters fought back in the ninth inning after trailing for the whole game but ultimately fell to a Kazuhiro Wada walk-off home run, losing 6–5. The Fighters would have to wait for another chance for the P.L. pennant. [ 2 ] During the pennant race, the Fighters began selling tickets for infield reserved seats at a low 1,500 yen price point, in an attempt to draw fans to the park. At and after 7:30 pm, usually well after the first pitch, the team began selling special child-fare tickets called \"730 Tickets\" (they started the same promotion at the Tokyo Dome in 2005). In addition to these, in 2005 they added extra-low priced tickets, discount parking passes and beer coupons to attract more fans. As a result of these promotions, and partially due to the rising popularity of young pitcher Yu Darvish , drafted the year before, the left field stands became constantly sold out for exhibition games, regular season games and playoff games, filled with loud and raucous Ōendan . Even the right field stands, usually occupied by the visiting team's fans, began to fill with Fighters supporters. In 2005, the Fighters drew over 1,000,000 fans for the first time since 1993, ranking second in the P.L. after the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks . Also in 2005, a previously unknown manager, Shigeru Takada , became the club's first general manager. On April 27, owner Yoshinori Ohkoso died. The Fighters retired the number 100 in his honor 4 years later, a first in club history (also the first retired number for owners in NPB;  in North American Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim ( Gene Autry , 26) and St. Louis Cardinals ( August A. Busch Jr. , 85) have retired numbers, and in Minor League Baseball , the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers ( Dale Earnhardt Sr., 3) are the most notable team owners with retired numbers). The number 100 was chosen, because when the Fighters won the 1981 Pacific League pennant, their first under Nippon-Ham, Okoso was given a ceremonial jersey number of 100. Yukio Tanaka reached a career 1,000 RBI total, and Makoto Kaneko joined the 1,000 hit club in the same year. On September 20 the Lions smashed the Fighters at home, crushing the Fighters’ hopes of making the playoffs for the second year in a row. In the offseason, the Fighters acquired Major League veteran José Macías , and as former number one starter Yusaku Iriki tried his luck in America, the club attempted to sign Kazuhisa Ishii , but failed. In the draft, the team selected pitchers Tomoya Yagi and Masaru Takeda . And before the 2006 season, Shigeyuki Furuki and Kazunari Sanematsu were traded to the Giants for pitcher Hideki Okajima . The 2006 season would turn out to be a monumental one for the Fighters. After defeating the Tokyo Yakult Swallows on the final day of interleague play, the Fighters went on an eleven-game winning streak, the best such streak for the franchise in over 45 years and tying the team record. After achieving the feat, the team had a six- and a seven-game winning streak, demonstrating to the rest of the P.L. that they were a dangerous club. A fierce struggle for first place developed between the Fighters, Lions and Hawks. On September 27, the Fighters emerged in first place, earning the title \"Regular Season Champions\".  They also boasted the best team ERA (3.05) and the best team home run total (135) in the NPB. Yu Darvish had an especially impressive year, winning 12 games and posting an ERA of 2.89, establishing himself as the ace of the Fighters’ staff. The Fighters swept the Hawks in the second stage of the P.L. playoffs to earn their third pennant. In the Japan Series, the team won their first Japanese championship in 44 years, defeating the Chunichi Dragons in five games. Fittingly, Darvish pitched for the win in the final game of the series. The series' MVP honors went to Fighters' outfielder Atsunori Inaba , who hit for a .357 batting average during the series with one home run and six RBIs. [ 3 ] The championship win was especially fitting for OF Tsuyoshi Shinjo, who was a longtime veteran of the Hanshin Tigers (who were perennial losers), and also had played for a brief time in the United States' Major League Baseball . It was Shinjo's ultimate desire to win a championship, and he did in the final year of his illustrious career in Japan with Nippon-Ham. Shinjo would return 14 years later for a tryout, but failed to qualify. He, however, would go on to be later named manager. This victory gave the Fighters a berth in the four-team Asia Series , in which the team went undefeated in the round-robin and won the final 1–0 over the La New Bears . The 2006 offseason saw the departure of two of Nippon-Ham's best players, both via free agency. First baseman Michihiro Ogasawara was signed to a blockbuster contract with the Yomiuri Giants , and left-handed reliever Hideki Okajima departed to the Boston Red Sox . At the start of the 2007 season, Nippon-Ham had a lot of trouble scoring runs, relying far too much on their pitching, despite the continuing maturation of Yu Darvish, who had back-to-back complete game, 14-strikeout performances early in the season. At one point, Nippon Ham was second-to-last in the Pacific League , but recently has been able to turn it around. With the start of Interleague play, Nippon-Ham began a 14-game winning streak, which ended on June 9 with a 3–2 extra inning loss to the Yakult Swallows , with the bullpen wasting another great performance by Darvish. The Fighters went on to win the Pacific League championship and went through the Climax Series to earn a second consecutive trip to the Japan Series to once again face the Chunichi Dragons. But in a reversal of roles from last year, the Fighters took Game 1, but the Dragons took the next four games to defeat the Fighters; the last of which being a combined perfect game by Dragons pitchers Daisuke Yamai and Hitoki Iwase. In 2007, Yukio Tanaka 's final season, he recorded his 2000th career hit, during a May 15 game against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles . The Fighters would win the Pacific League championship again in 2009 and 2012, but they would lose both times in the Japan Series to the Yomiuri Giants. In 2012, the Fighters drafted Shohei Ohtani , who made his debut in 2013. Despite Otani wanting to play in MLB, the Fighters drafted him anyways as they would have lost him to an MLB team. Otani signed with the Fighters nonetheless. Otani, with his ability to both pitch and hit, quickly became a star for the team. He was selected as an NPB all-star five times and was named Pacific League MVP in 2016. Behind Otani, the Fighters returned to the Japan Series in 2016 , facing the Hiroshima Toyo Carp .  After dropping the first two games on the road, the Fighters rallied to win the next four games en route to their first championship since 2006. In 2017, the Fighters drafted Kotaro Kiyomiya , a child prodigy entering the draft with high expectations and a number 1 overall pick. The Fighters got his contract negotiation rights after winning a lottery in the draft between 6 other NPB teams. As Japan would soon find out however, he became a draft bust. What made it even worse was Munetaka Murakami , also on Kiyomiya's draft class, who was drafted by the Swallows after losing out to him, was hitting more home runs than him at a rapid pace and already won a Japan Series title with the Swallows. As of 2022, Kiyomiya only had 21 home runs, while Murakami already had 104, and became the youngest NPB player to hit 100 home runs, at only 22 years old. Kiyomiya also did not play on the first squad in 2021. Kiyomiya was also being plagued by injuries, whilst Murakami managed to stay healthy and has played the full 143 game schedule with the Swallows. However, in recent years, Kiyomiya would develop himself into a better player, and by 2024, he was back as a regular on the Fighters top team. In 2017, Otani left the Fighters to sign with the Los Angeles Angels . On January 8, 2018, the Fighters signed a partnership agreement with the Texas Rangers to exchange scouting info with each other and the Rangers will share advice to the Fighters for their plans to build ES-CON Field Hokkaido.  ES-CON Field plans would be similar to the then-under construction Globe Life Field in Arlington . Both ballparks would have mixed use community districts, [ 4 ] and similar structure, hence why both ballparks look very similar. Also, this was due to the stadium being designed by HKS Architects , who also designed Globe Life Field. In October 2021, the Fighters replaced longtime manager Hideki Kuriyama , who went on to become manager of Samurai Japan , with former player Tsuyoshi Shinjo . He is best known for winning his first Japan Series title in his last game before retirement. On January 21, 2022, new manager Tsuyoshi Shinjo unveiled a new logo and uniform for the Fighters. The response from fans was mixed to mostly negative. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Fans often compared their jerseys to the Toronto Blue Jays due to the font they used. [ 7 ] On March 24, 2022, Shinjo was approved by the NPB to be registered as \"BIGBOSS\" for the 2022 season . [ 8 ] On September 28, 2022, the Fighters played their final game at Sapporo Dome, an 11–3 loss to the Chiba Lotte Marines and the team finished the season with the worst record in the NPB. After the game, it was announced that Tsuyoshi Shinjo would continue being manager for the 2023 season, but he will not wear \"BIGBOSS\" on his jersey, and that the BIGBOSS persona would be retired. [ 9 ] They would again fare poorly in the 2023 season, finishing with the 3rd worst record in the NPB, primarily thanks to the team suffering a 14 game losing streak in the middle of the year, including 7 straight games of losing by a lone run. However, one of the biggest standouts that year was from Japanese-Congo player Chusei Mannami , who finished with the second most home runs in Pacific League, hitting 25, just below Gregory Polanco , Kensuke Kondoh , and Hideto Asamura , who all hit 26 each. He also became the second player in NPB history to hit a lead-off and walk-off home run in the same game against the Hawks in September. 2024 would prove to be a standout year for the Fighters, finally making the playoffs for the first time since 2018, with a record of 75-60-8, finishing in 2nd place. Among individual accomplishments included Chusei Mannami winning his second Golden Glove award, new foreign signing Franmil Reyes making the Best Nine for the Pacific League, alongside breaking Fernando Seguignol's Fighters record for most consecutive games with a hit at 25 games, and Shun Mizutani , whom the Fighters acquired from the Hawks in the active player draft, having a breakout season, culminating in him winning Interleague MVP.  In the postseason, after going down in the first game against the Chiba Lotte Marines, and seeming to be going down in the second, with Shinjo stating he wasn't going to use team ace Hiromi Itoh , because he thought he would be needed for the Final Stage against the Hawks, Mannami would hit a game tying home run off Naoya Masuda , then Daiki Asama would then hit a walkoff hit an inning later. After winning the 3rd game, the Fighters would advance to the Final Stage, where they would get swept by the Hawks in 3 games, with SoftBank getting a 1 game advantage. The Fox Dance [ edit ] The Fox Dance is a tradition of the Fighters to do during the middle of innings, in which they encouraged fans, alongside cheerleaders, to dance similarly to the moves of a fox, set to the Ylvis song \" The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?) \", which began in May 2022. The origins of this tradition came from Fighters staff member and former Fighters Girl member Sari Ogure, who watched the music video 2 years prior. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic disallowing an...

It correctly identifies Finn as the mythical hunter-warrior of Irish mythology and mentions the Salmon of Knowledge as the source of his wisdom. However, it does not mention the specific act of Finn inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slay Aillen, which is the correct answer according to the reference response. So the overall score is 4. gpt-4-1106-preview 1 Feedback: The response provided is not aligned with the reference answer. The act of consuming the Salmon of Knowledge is indeed a significant event in the mythology surrounding Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), but it is not the act that won him the leadership of the Fianna according to the reference answer provided. The reference answer states that the act which won him the leadership was inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slaying Aillen. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect as it refers to a different event in the mythology of the character, not the one that is directly linked to his leadership of the Fianna. 2023-12-18T19:02:15 2023-12-18T19:02:47 HotpotQA-easy 2 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style Roxanne Quimby, is an American artist, conservationist and businesswoman notable for founding which North Carolina-based personal care products company with the eponymous beekeeper, Ingram Berg \"Burt\" Shavitz, was an American beekeeper and businessman notable for founding which personal care products company?

No hit, no runs in the first innings \"I\\'m a little relieved\" Sports Hochi 2025.5.4(日) 06:40 ◆ Pacific League Seibu 4-3 Nippon-Ham (3rd, ES CON FIELD) Nippon-Ham lost a close game against Seibu 3-4 in the 3rd to stop their winning streak at 3. In the 8th inning, Taisho Tamai pitcher (32) made his first appearance for the first time in 576 days since October 5, 2023 against Rakuten (Rakuten Mobile). Hit by Pitch hit runs closer The iron arm, who has pitched in 40 or more games for six consecutive years since 2006, returned to the first team bullpen. There was no time to be emotional. It was his first appearance of the season, and it was only nine days after his promotion. After getting the third out with a grounder to third base, Tamai (pictured) took a sigh and slowly returned to the bench. After a first-team mound in 576 days, he finished with no hit no runs, and reflected, \"For now, it\\'s good that I was able closer at zero. I\\'m a little relieved.\" There were also moments when he showed his true colors. He threw a pitch inside to Nevin, who had hit a home run, and allowed the only runner on Hit by Pitch. \"That\\'s part of my pitching. It\\'s best to not hit the ball and throw it inside, but I hope I can do that more and more in the future.\" Even after a break, his aggressive pitching style has not changed. Last season, he did not pitch in the first team due to back pain. During the off-season, he also worked on sidearm pitching, and said, \"I realized a lot of things and was able to try a lot of different things, so it was a meaningful year.\" His arm has improved back to a slightly lower position than last season, but that is also part of the process of evolution. Looking ahead, he said, \"My pitching in the future will make me think that it was good that I spent last year in that way.\" The season has just begun. \"I\\'m in a position where I can\\'t relax. I want to concentrate on each game and prepare well so that I can pitch the way I want to.\" With bullpen getting stronger, he will overturn Manager Shinjo\\'s ranking. (Yamaguchi Yasushi) struck out runner hit runs pitcher The first two are the first two innings of the season, and the second two innings are the first two innings of the season, and the third two innings are the first two innings of the season, and the fourth two innings are the first two innings of the season. I couldn\\'t prevent them from scoring the next run.

However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address.

It correctly identifies Finn as the mythical hunter-warrior of Irish mythology and mentions the Salmon of Knowledge as the source of his wisdom. However, it does not mention the specific act of Finn inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slay Aillen, which is the correct answer according to the reference response. So the overall score is 4. gpt-4-1106-preview 1 Feedback: The response provided is not aligned with the reference answer. The act of consuming the Salmon of Knowledge is indeed a significant event in the mythology surrounding Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), but it is not the act that won him the leadership of the Fianna according to the reference answer provided. The reference answer states that the act which won him the leadership was inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slaying Aillen. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect as it refers to a different event in the mythology of the character, not the one that is directly linked to his leadership of the Fianna. 2023-12-18T19:02:15 2023-12-18T19:02:47 HotpotQA-easy 2 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style Roxanne Quimby, is an American artist, conservationist and businesswoman notable for founding which North Carolina-based personal care products company with the eponymous beekeeper, Ingram Berg \"Burt\" Shavitz, was an American beekeeper and businessman notable for founding which personal care products company?

They compete in the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball , playing the majority of their home games at ES CON Field Hokkaido . The Fighters also host a select number of regional home games in cities across Hokkaidō, including Hakodate , Asahikawa , Kushiro , and Obihiro . The team\\'s name comes from its parent organization, Nippon Ham , a major Japanese food-processing company. Founded in 1946, the Fighters called Tokyo home for 58 years, as co-tenants of the Tokyo Dome and Korakuen Stadium with the Central League \\'s Yomiuri Giants near the end of their tenure in the capital city. The franchise has won three Japan Series titles, in 1962, 2006, and, most recently, 2016. Team history [ edit ] Senators and Tokyo eras [ edit ] In 1946, Saburo Yokozawa , manager of the Tokyo Senators in 1936–1937 (and later a prominent umpire), looked to revive the franchise and soon founded the new Senators . He assembled a team of ready and able players like Hiroshi Oshita , Shigeya Iijima and Giichiro Shiraki , but as a newly formed team the Senators faced strict fiscal management and resorted to using hand-me-down uniforms from the Hankyu Railway\\'s pre-war team (who would eventually become the modern-day Orix Buffaloes ). Former Japanese statesman Kinkazu Saionji , grandson of the influential Kinmochi Saionji , became the team\\'s owner, and Noboru Oride , borrowing heavily from a Ginza cabaret proprietor, became the team\\'s sponsor. Eventually, trapped by a lack of funds, Yokozawa was forced to resign as the team\\'s manager. For a time, the team was even mockingly nicknamed \"Seito\" (Bluestockings) after a Japanese feminist magazine of the same name . As the Yomiuri Giants \\' pet name was \"Kyojin\", baseball personality Soutaro Suzuki thought that other teams should also have pet names like the Giants, and names such as the Osaka Tigers \\' alias \"Mouko\" (fierce tiger), the Senators\\' \"Seito\" and the Pacific \\'s \"Taihei\" (tranquility) began to be used by the press . However, the other teams rejected the use of these pet names, so they were not fully adopted. On January 7, 1947, the team was sold to the Tokyu Corporation . The Tokyu baseball club was inaugurated into the league, and the team\\'s name became the Tokyu Flyers . At that time Tokyu dominated the Japanese transportation sector, owning several other railway companies, although it was faced with troubles and the possibility of a breakup. Tokyu purchased the team to act as a banner of solidarity for the swelling company, and managing director Hiroshi Okawa assumed ownership of the club. The newly born Flyers, with Hiroshi Oshita becoming one of the most popular players in the league , began to attract many fans, but the team\\'s administration still went into a deficit. With the formation of the National Baseball League drawing nearer, in 1948 the not-yet-affiliated Daiei club , which had played a few exhibition games against the Otsuka Athletics , joined with Tokyu to create the Kyuei Flyers (\"Kyuei\" being a portmanteau of the two companies\\' names). However, Daiei decided to purchase a separate team, the Kinsei Stars , and after only one year the Flyers reverted to their former name. During the off-season of 1949, the Flyers joined the Pacific League after the former league split. In September 1953, the team completed a new ballpark— Komazawa Stadium —along one of Tokyu\\'s train lines in Setagaya , Tokyo, moving from Bunkyo ward\\'s Korakuen Stadium . The Flyers\\' wild play on the field eventually earned them the nickname, \"Komazawa\\'s hooligans\". Toei and Nittaku eras [ edit ] On February 1, 1954, Tokyu entrusted the management of the Flyers to the Toei Company , of which Okawa had newly become president. Toei transferred control of the club to a subsidiary company, Toei Kogyo (industrial enterprise). The team\\'s name was changed to the Toei Flyers , and its legal name consequently became the Toei Flyers Baseball Club. This name stuck for nineteen years. In 1961, when Yomiuri Giants manager Shigeru Mizuhara resigned from his position, Okawa attempted to woo him to join his team, bringing him to a bar in Kyoto and calling famous movie producer Koji Shundo to meet with them. Shundo, an old drinking buddy of Mizuhara\\'s, convinced the four-time Japan Series champion manager to join the Flyers, and he solidified a strong relationship with Okawa and Toei Studios. Komazawa Stadium was to be torn down to make way for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics , so in 1962 the Flyers moved their base of operations to Meiji Jingu Stadium in Shinjuku . (At that time, college baseball teams had priority at Meiji Jingu, so during weekends or other times when school games were being played the Flyers had to use Korakuen or another field for their games.)  In the same year, two star aces, Masayuki Dobashi and Yukio Ozaki, blossomed under Mizuhara\\'s coaching and the Flyers captured their first league championship. They would go on to defy odds in the Japan Series and defeat the Hanshin Tigers for their first Japan Series title. This championship would be their only one in the Toei era. The Kokutetsu Swallows jointly occupied Meiji Jingu with the Flyers the following season, and in 1964 the Flyers went back to their old home, Korakuen, also home of the Yomiuri Giants ; both the Fighters and Giants would share a home for the next 39 years. The Flyers assembled a group of powerful sluggers over the next few years—among them: Isao Harimoto , Katsuo Osugi, Inchon Bek , and Shoichi Busujima —but on top of a declining movie industry and the \" Black Mist \" match-fixing scandal that rocked the professional baseball world in 1970 (after which Flyers ace Toshiaki Moriyasu was banned from the game for life), in 1971 Flyers owner Okawa died suddenly. Shigeru Okada , who did not view Okawa favorably, took over Toei after his death. Together with Noboru Goto , company president of Tokyu and loyal friend of Okada (and one who also thought unfavorably of Okawa), Okada let go of the unprofitable team. The team was sold to Akitaka Nishimura of the Nittaku Home real estate enterprise, a common acquaintance of Okada and Goto, on February 7, 1973. The team\\'s name became the Nittaku Home Flyers . Nishimura, in an attempt to inject life back into the unpopular Pacific League, developed seven different uniforms for his team and experimented in every aspect of the team\\'s operation, but the effort failed to produce results. Believing that the Pacific League\\'s chances of survival were grim, Nishimura was on the verge of partnering with the Lotte Orions , who were eyeing a league reunification. When the deal fell through, Nishimura, tired of the baseball establishment, resigned from his leadership position and abandoned the Flyers. Nippon-Ham era [ edit ] On November 19, 1973, meatpacking company Nippon Ham purchased the team, led by owner Yoshinori Okoso. Okoso had bought the team as he was willing to bring them back to prominence when essentially no one wanted them. He loved them to death, so much so that he never held any company meetings when the team was playing, and if where he was at, they were not on TV or radio, he would dispatch employees to go to that game and update him via payphone . The club\\'s name was changed to the Nippon-Ham Fighters , its official name became the Nippon-Ham Baseball Corporation. Osamu Mihara became the team president and Futoshi Nakanishi , Mihara\\'s son-in-law, as its manager. After 27 years, the \"Flyers\" nickname was abandoned. The \"Fighters\" nickname was born from a public appeal by the team\\'s management. A female high school student from Okayama prefecture submitted the winning name, giving the reasoning that \"(former Fighters player) Katsuo Osugi has guts, so he\\'s a fighter.\"  Osugi would be traded to the Yakult Swallows soon after the Fighters were rechristened. The same would be for Zainichi Korean Isao Harimoto , as Nakanishi hated Harimoto for challenging his authority, going nearly as far as trying to release him. This was also because Harimoto was upset that the FIghters sent away Osugi, and that he was the only reason he stuck around. In fact, when the then-Flyers attempted to trade Osugi to the Hanshin Tigers for Yutaka Enatsu (who the Fighters would ironically get later), Harimoto went to the front office and demanded they immediately cancel the trade. However, Okoso did not want to let him go, as Nippon-Ham had a major presence in South Korea, and it did wonders for sales having one of the greatest Koreans play for them, and having traded their other Korean player, Baek In-chun , to the Taiheyo Club Lions in 1974, Okoso was worried Nippon-Ham would completely lose their presence in South Korea. Mihara, however, persisted, and they nearly sent him to the Hanshin Tigers, before the Yomiuri Giants made a convincing last-minute deal to send him there instead. Over the four seasons between 1974 and 1977, the Fighters dwelled at the bottom of the Pacific League, but after improving to finishing in third place for three straight years between 1978 and 1980, manager Keiji Osawa finally led the Fighters to their second Pacific League pennant in 1981. With saves leader Yutaka Enatsu and starter Shigekuni Mashiba (who went 15–0 over the season) forming the heart of the pitching staff, the Fighters shined with offensive sluggers Tony Solaita , Junichi Kashiwabara , and Tommy Cruz . The team that year also featured various important players of smaller stature, like Makoto Shimada and Nobuhiro Takashiro . They would go on to play the Yomiuri Giants in the Japan Series, where the Fighters lost in six games. At the time, the franchise shared Korakuen Stadium with the Giants, so scheduling games throughout the season for both teams posed a problem. League schedulers tried to avoid putting the Fighters and the Giants at Korakuen on the same day, but when they both had home games scheduled, league officials made the implicit decision that the Giants would play during the day and the Fighters during the night. One novel aspect of the Fighters was that they attracted armies of grade-school boys to sit in the outfield stands on weekend games under a \"Young Boys’ Fan Club\" promotion, starting the first organized fan club in Japanese professional baseball. During the 1980s the Fighters hosted many of the Pacific League\\'s leading pitchers, including Isamu Kida (led the P.L. with 22 wins in his rookie year in 1980; won MVP , Rookie of the Year the same year), Mikio Kudō (20 wins in 1982), Hiroshi Tsuno (recorded double-digit win totals in several years throughout the mid-eighties) and Yasumitsu Shibata (three-time All Star; recorded no-hitter in 1990). Yukihiro Nishizaki particularly stood out, recording 15 wins and an ERA under three in each of his first two years (though the Rookie of the Year title eluded him), racking up seven double-digit win seasons over the course of his eleven-year stay with the Fighters and gaining a considerable following from female fans due to his easy-going demeanor. In 1986 shortstop Yukio Tanaka joined the club; he remained with the team for 22 seasons, becoming known as \"Mr. Fighters\". [ 1 ] Tokyo Dome, former ballpark of the Fighters From 1988 until the move to Hokkaidō , the Fighters played their home games in Tokyo Dome , the stadium that replaced their longtime home Korakuen. After the Dome was finished, the pitching dominance of Yukihiro Nishizaki and Yasumitsu Shibata began to emerge. Keiji Osawa came out of retirement to manage the team for a third time in 1993, only to see his team sink to the bottom of the standings; he gained notoriety for kneeling to the fans at the end of that season, begging for their forgiveness. With the Fighters experiencing more managerial troubles in 1996, then-manager Toshiharu Ueda suddenly took a personal leave during a pennant race with the Orix BlueWave , eventually causing the Fighters to fade over the last month of the season. However, new life was born in Tokyo Dome in 1998. Hitters such as Nigel Wilson , Jerry Brooks , Yukio Tanaka , Atsushi Kataoka , Katsuhiro Nishiura and a young Michihiro Ogasawara formed what became known as the Big Bang lineup and subsequently shattered various batting records. They ran away with first place for the first half of the season, but a pitching collapse in the second half caused a fall of historical proportions. The Fighters would ultimately finish in second place to the Seibu Lions . Hokkaido Nippon-Ham era [ edit ] Sapporo Dome in 2004 Sapporo dome Prior to the 2002 season, the idea of moving the Fighters to Sapporo , the capital of Hokkaidō and Japan\\'s fifth largest city, emerged. The Seibu Lions also had preliminary plans to move to the northern metropolis. Tokyo\\'s Fighters fans voiced their opposition to the proposed relocation (though the franchise never drew as many fans as their co-habitual counterparts, the Giants, while playing in the capital), but it was eventually announced that the team would indeed call the Sapporo Dome its new home beginning in 2004. Aiming to build a grassroots relationship with its future fans, the team decided to change its name to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters . At first, with the unhappy Seibu Lions suddenly changing their approval vote, Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe and Seibu owner Yoshiaki Tsutsumi voiced their concerns over the move. They believed that Nippon Ham\\'s choice to move the team would spur a decentralization in Japanese professional baseball, and they threatened that a decrease in the number of teams in the Kantō and Kansai regions should merit a one-league system instead of two. As a matter of fact, the question of reorganizing baseball\\'s league structure eventually became a bigger issue than the sale and renaming of the Kintetsu Buffaloes . The issue eventually settled down, though, and the Fighters\\' relocation was eventually approved by the league. The response from the people of Hokkaidō was weak, but NPB fans welcomed the move, noting that the Fighters could now be free from the Tokyo Dome\\'s high rent and perpetual second-billing to the Giants. Out of respect for the Tokyo-based Fighters fans, the team decided to schedule a few \"home\" games per season at the Tokyo Dome. After the move finally was complete in 2004, the Fighters signed former-Tigers superstar Tsuyoshi Shinjo , who came back to NPB from MLB after playing with the New York Mets and nearly winning a World Series title with the San Francisco Giants and a revitalized Fernando Seguignol . American manager Trey Hillman led the team to success in his second year on the job, and at the end of the season, the Fighters were in a fierce race with the Chiba Lotte Marines for the final spot in the new P.L. playoff system. With a vital win over the Orix BlueWave on September 24, the newly moved Fighters earned a trip to the postseason, advancing to play Seibu in a three-game series. Though they put up a strong effort against Seibu ace Daisuke Matsuzaka , the Fighters lost the first game of the series 6–5. They took Game 2 by a score of 5–4. In the decisive third game, the Fighters fought back in the ninth inning after trailing for the whole game but ultimately fell to a Kazuhiro Wada walk-off home run, losing 6–5. The Fighters would have to wait for another chance for the P.L. pennant. [ 2 ] During the pennant race, the Fighters began selling tickets for infield reserved seats at a low 1,500 yen price point, in an attempt to draw fans to the park. At and after 7:30\\xa0pm, usually well after the first pitch, the team began selling special child-fare tickets called \"730 Tickets\" (they started the same promotion at the Tokyo Dome in 2005). In addition to these, in 2005 they added extra-low priced tickets, discount parking passes and beer coupons to attract more fans. As a result of these promotions, and partially due to the rising popularity of young pitcher Yu Darvish , drafted the year before, the left field stands became constantly sold out for exhibition games, regular season games and playoff games, filled with loud and raucous Ōendan . Even the right field stands, usually occupied by the visiting team\\'s fans, began to fill with Fighters supporters. In 2005, the Fighters drew over 1,000,000 fans for the first time since 1993, ranking second in the P.L. after the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks . Also in 2005, a previously unknown manager, Shigeru Takada , became the club\\'s first general manager. On April 27, owner Yoshinori Ohkoso died. The Fighters retired the number 100 in his honor 4 years later, a first in club history (also the first retired number for owners in NPB;  in North American Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim ( Gene Autry , 26) and St. Louis Cardinals ( August A. Busch Jr. , 85) have retired numbers, and in Minor League Baseball , the Kannapolis Cannon Ballers ( Dale Earnhardt Sr., 3) are the most notable team owners with retired numbers). The number 100 was chosen, because when the Fighters won the 1981 Pacific League pennant, their first under Nippon-Ham, Okoso was given a ceremonial jersey number of 100. Yukio Tanaka reached a career 1,000 RBI total, and Makoto Kaneko joined the 1,000 hit club in the same year. On September 20 the Lions smashed the Fighters at home, crushing the Fighters’ hopes of making the playoffs for the second year in a row. In the offseason, the Fighters acquired Major League veteran José Macías , and as former number one starter Yusaku Iriki tried his luck in America, the club attempted to sign Kazuhisa Ishii , but failed. In the draft, the team selected pitchers Tomoya Yagi and Masaru Takeda . And before the 2006 season, Shigeyuki Furuki and Kazunari Sanematsu were traded to the Giants for pitcher Hideki Okajima . The 2006 season would turn out to be a monumental one for the Fighters. After defeating the Tokyo Yakult Swallows on the final day of interleague play, the Fighters went on an eleven-game winning streak, the best such streak for the franchise in over 45\\xa0years and tying the team record. After achieving the feat, the team had a six- and a seven-game winning streak, demonstrating to the rest of the P.L. that they were a dangerous club. A fierce struggle for first place developed between the Fighters, Lions and Hawks. On September 27, the Fighters emerged in first place, earning the title \"Regular Season Champions\".  They also boasted the best team ERA (3.05) and the best team home run total (135) in the NPB. Yu Darvish had an especially impressive year, winning 12\\xa0games and posting an ERA of 2.89, establishing himself as the ace of the Fighters’ staff. The Fighters swept the Hawks in the second stage of the P.L. playoffs to earn their third pennant. In the Japan Series, the team won their first Japanese championship in 44\\xa0years, defeating the Chunichi Dragons in five games. Fittingly, Darvish pitched for the win in the final game of the series. The series\\' MVP honors went to Fighters\\' outfielder Atsunori Inaba , who hit for a .357 batting average during the series with one home run and six RBIs. [ 3 ] The championship win was especially fitting for OF Tsuyoshi Shinjo, who was a longtime veteran of the Hanshin Tigers (who were perennial losers), and also had played for a brief time in the United States\\' Major League Baseball . It was Shinjo\\'s ultimate desire to win a championship, and he did in the final year of his illustrious career in Japan with Nippon-Ham. Shinjo would return 14 years later for a tryout, but failed to qualify. He, however, would go on to be later named manager. This victory gave the Fighters a berth in the four-team Asia Series , in which the team went undefeated in the round-robin and won the final 1–0 over the La New Bears . The 2006 offseason saw the departure of two of Nippon-Ham\\'s best players, both via free agency. First baseman Michihiro Ogasawara was signed to a blockbuster contract with the Yomiuri Giants , and left-handed reliever Hideki Okajima departed to the Boston Red Sox . At the start of the 2007 season, Nippon-Ham had a lot of trouble scoring runs, relying far too much on their pitching, despite the continuing maturation of Yu Darvish, who had back-to-back complete game, 14-strikeout performances early in the season. At one point, Nippon Ham was second-to-last in the Pacific League , but recently has been able to turn it around. With the start of Interleague play, Nippon-Ham began a 14-game winning streak, which ended on June 9 with a 3–2 extra inning loss to the Yakult Swallows , with the bullpen wasting another great performance by Darvish. The Fighters went on to win the Pacific League championship and went through the Climax Series to earn a second consecutive trip to the Japan Series to once again face the Chunichi Dragons. But in a reversal of roles from last year, the Fighters took Game 1, but the Dragons took the next four games to defeat the Fighters; the last of which being a combined perfect game by Dragons pitchers Daisuke Yamai and Hitoki Iwase. In 2007, Yukio Tanaka \\'s final season, he recorded his 2000th career hit, during a May 15 game against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles . The Fighters would win the Pacific League championship again in 2009 and 2012, but they would lose both times in the Japan Series to the Yomiuri Giants. In 2012, the Fighters drafted Shohei Ohtani , who made his debut in 2013. Despite Otani wanting to play in MLB, the Fighters drafted him anyways as they would have lost him to an MLB team. Otani signed with the Fighters nonetheless. Otani, with his ability to both pitch and hit, quickly became a star for the team. He was selected as an NPB all-star five times and was named Pacific League MVP in 2016. Behind Otani, the Fighters returned to the Japan Series in 2016 , facing the Hiroshima Toyo Carp .  After dropping the first two games on the road, the Fighters rallied to win the next four games en route to their first championship since 2006. In 2017, the Fighters drafted Kotaro Kiyomiya , a child prodigy entering the draft with high expectations and a number 1 overall pick. The Fighters got his contract negotiation rights after winning a lottery in the draft between 6 other NPB teams. As Japan would soon find out however, he became a draft bust. What made it even worse was Munetaka Murakami , also on Kiyomiya\\'s draft class, who was drafted by the Swallows after losing out to him, was hitting more home runs than him at a rapid pace and already won a Japan Series title with the Swallows. As of 2022, Kiyomiya only had 21 home runs, while Murakami already had 104, and became the youngest NPB player to hit 100 home runs, at only 22 years old. Kiyomiya also did not play on the first squad in 2021. Kiyomiya was also being plagued by injuries, whilst Murakami managed to stay healthy and has played the full 143 game schedule with the Swallows. However, in recent years, Kiyomiya would develop himself into a better player, and by 2024, he was back as a regular on the Fighters top team. In 2017, Otani left the Fighters to sign with the Los Angeles Angels . On January 8, 2018, the Fighters signed a partnership agreement with the Texas Rangers to exchange scouting info with each other and the Rangers will share advice to the Fighters for their plans to build ES-CON Field Hokkaido.  ES-CON Field plans would be similar to the then-under construction Globe Life Field in Arlington . Both ballparks would have mixed use community districts, [ 4 ] and similar structure, hence why both ballparks look very similar. Also, this was due to the stadium being designed by HKS Architects , who also designed Globe Life Field. In October 2021, the Fighters replaced longtime manager Hideki Kuriyama , who went on to become manager of Samurai Japan , with former player Tsuyoshi Shinjo . He is best known for winning his first Japan Series title in his last game before retirement. On January 21, 2022, new manager Tsuyoshi Shinjo unveiled a new logo and uniform for the Fighters. The response from fans was mixed to mostly negative. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Fans often compared their jerseys to the Toronto Blue Jays due to the font they used. [ 7 ] On March 24, 2022, Shinjo was approved by the NPB to be registered as \"BIGBOSS\" for the 2022 season . [ 8 ] On September 28, 2022, the Fighters played their final game at Sapporo Dome, an 11–3 loss to the Chiba Lotte Marines and the team finished the season with the worst record in the NPB. After the game, it was announced that Tsuyoshi Shinjo would continue being manager for the 2023 season, but he will not wear \"BIGBOSS\" on his jersey, and that the BIGBOSS persona would be retired. [ 9 ] They would again fare poorly in the 2023 season, finishing with the 3rd worst record in the NPB, primarily thanks to the team suffering a 14 game losing streak in the middle of the year, including 7 straight games of losing by a lone run. However, one of the biggest standouts that year was from Japanese-Congo player Chusei Mannami , who finished with the second most home runs in Pacific League, hitting 25, just below Gregory Polanco , Kensuke Kondoh , and Hideto Asamura , who all hit 26 each. He also became the second player in NPB history to hit a lead-off and walk-off home run in the same game against the Hawks in September. 2024 would prove to be a standout year for the Fighters, finally making the playoffs for the first time since 2018, with a record of 75-60-8, finishing in 2nd place. Among individual accomplishments included Chusei Mannami winning his second Golden Glove award, new foreign signing Franmil Reyes making the Best Nine for the Pacific League, alongside breaking Fernando Seguignol\\'s Fighters record for most consecutive games with a hit at 25 games, and Shun Mizutani , whom the Fighters acquired from the Hawks in the active player draft, having a breakout season, culminating in him winning Interleague MVP.  In the postseason, after going down in the first game against the Chiba Lotte Marines, and seeming to be going down in the second, with Shinjo stating he wasn\\'t going to use team ace Hiromi Itoh , because he thought he would be needed for the Final Stage against the Hawks, Mannami would hit a game tying home run off Naoya Masuda , then Daiki Asama would then hit a walkoff hit an inning later. After winning the 3rd game, the Fighters would advance to the Final Stage, where they would get swept by the Hawks in 3 games, with SoftBank getting a 1 game advantage. The Fox Dance [ edit ] The Fox Dance is a tradition of the Fighters to do during the middle of innings, in which they encouraged fans, alongside cheerleaders, to dance similarly to the moves of a fox, set to the Ylvis song \" The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?) \", which began in May 2022. The origins of this tradition came from Fighters staff member and former Fighters Girl member Sari Ogure, who watched the music video 2 years prior. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic disallowing an...

Price a dish too high, and customers won’t order them. Price a dish too low, and you won’t generate enough revenue to cover your expenses. Lucky for you, we’ve got restaurant pricing down to a science. We’re revealing how to set menu prices that will cover your expenses and ensure that your restaurant is financially healthy. One of the key concepts you need to understand to set proper menu prices is your food cost percentage. This important metric shows how much of your overall sales are spent on ingredients and food supplies. Keeping tabs on your food costs will help you set menu prices and maximize profits. In this post, we’ll walk you through how to find the following and use it to set menu prices: What is restaurant food cost? Calculating your food cost percentage Why is your food cost percentage important? What is a good food cost percentage? How to lower food costs Setting profitable menu prices How to monitor menu pricing’s effect on sales But before we dive in, what are food costs exactly? Don't feel like doing math? Our free food cost calculator takes the hard work out of calculating your food cost. It's never been easier to set profitable prices for your menu. Calculate my food cost What is restaurant food cost? Food cost is the ratio of a restaurant’s cost of ingredients (food inventory) and the revenue that those ingredients generate when the menu items are sold (food sales). Food cost is almost always expressed as a percentage known as food cost percentage, which we’ll cover further below. While some restaurants use food cost to determine the price of making a dish for a restaurant, others prefer to use the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) , which measures the total value of inventory used to make a dish, down to the toothpick, napkin and garnishes. What to do before you start food costing Budgeting is a crucial part of running a business. It’s not something you do only when you create your business plan, but an ongoing process that you monitor to keep your restaurant profitable. Reviewing your budget on a regular basis helps you keep track of your finances and achieve success. Although many of us feel anxious or confused when we have to think about numbers, the process doesn’t have to be difficult and complicated. Monitoring your cash flow and managing your restaurant budget can be easily done with the right tools, and you’ll have peace of mind knowing you’re on top of everything. An accounting software helps you manage your books and records, as well as your inventory and transactions quickly and accurately. If you have a POS system with inventory management capability that tracks all your inventory and purchases, you can simply sync your data with your accounting software and the rest will be taken care of. However, if you want to go about it the old-fashioned way, here are a few budgetary items to keep in mind: Track all of your numbers. Whether your POS system does it for you or you do it yourself, you have to know your prime cost, or the ratio between your sales and cost. Define your accounting period. While most restaurants follow a four-week accounting period, you can set it to whatever time length makes the most sense for your business. Set budget targets. Budgets aren’t just reflections of what’s happening in your restaurant—they should be guides that lead your restaurant to maximum efficiency. Focus on a weekly operational budget. High-level views of your restaurant’s financial health are important, but there’s something to be said for having a more granular view of your operations as well. It can help you to track your expenses more easily because the scale is smaller and more manageable. Once your budgeting system is firmly in place, you can get started with food costing. Food cost percentage explained While some restaurateurs don’t take food cost percentage seriously, you shouldn’t be one of them. Maintaining as low of a food cost percentage as possible (without sacrificing food quality) leaves more gross profit to pay for other expenses and have revenue leftover. In this section, we’ll cover: What food cost percentage is Why it’s important to calculate your food cost percentage What the ideal food cost percentage is How to calculate food cost percentage Examples of how to calculate food cost percentage What is food cost percentage? Food cost percentage is the value of food costs to revenue expressed as a percentage. The figure helps restaurants set menu prices. How to calculate food cost percentage To calculate food cost percentage, you need to first have values for the following things: Beginning inventory value: the dollar value of the inventory you purchased at the beginning of the week. Purchases: the dollar value of the inventory you purchase throughout the week and wasn’t part of your beginning inventory. Ending inventory: the dollar value of the inventory left over at the end of the week. Total food sales: the dollar value of your sales for the week, which you can find in your sales reports . Food cost percentage formula To calculate your food cost percentage, first add the value of your beginning inventory and your purchases, and subtract the value of your ending inventory from the total. Finally, divide the result into your total food sales. Food cost percentage explained Let’s see how Johnny’s Burger Bar would calculate their food cost percentage using these values: Beginning inventory value = $11,000 Purchases = $7,000 Ending inventory value = $15,000 Total food sales = $8,000 Food cost percentage = (11,000 + 7,000) – 15,000 / 8,000 Food cost percentage = 18,000 – 15,000 / 8,000 Food cost percentage = 3,000 / 8,000 Food cost percentage = 0.375, or 37.5% Johnny’s Burger Bar’s food cost percentage is 37.5% , meaning that 37.5% of their revenues go towards paying for ingredients. That’s above the industry average for burger joints, which makes Johnny wonder if he should tweak his menu prices. To know for sure, he needs to calculate his ideal food cost percentage and compare it to his actual food cost percentage. How to calculate ideal food cost percentage To find your ideal food cost percentage, you first need to know two values: Total food costs Total food sales Let’s say their total food costs were $2,500 and, as we see above, their total food sales are $8,000. To calculate ideal food cost percentage, divide total food costs into total food sales. Ideal food cost = $2,500 / 8,000 Ideal food cost = 0.31, or 31% As it turns out, Johnny’s Burger Bar’s ideal food cost is 31%. Knowing that their current food cost percentage calculation is 37.5%, it’s clear that Johnny is missing out on 6.5% more revenue. What is a good food cost percentage? To run a profitable restaurant, most owners and operators keep food costs between 28 and 35% of revenue. With that said, there is no such thing as an ideal food cost percentage; it varies depending on the type of food they serve and the restaurant’s overhead and operating expenses. A common misconception about food cost percentage is that every restaurant should aim for a perfect number. In reality, a healthy percentage can vary greatly depending on the products you sell, food cost control and the market you serve. Food cost percentage examples for restaurants For example, a steakhouse can run a food cost percentage close to 35% because the cost of its ingredients are much higher. On the other hand, a restaurant that serves primarily pasta, which is cheap to buy in bulk, might run somewhere around 28%. Both percentages are acceptable according to the context of the restaurant. Each restaurant should calculate their food cost percentage and not rely on catch-all averages, but the general consensus is that the higher your total restaurant expenses are (including food costs), the higher your menu prices need to be. Food cost per serving explained Before you determine the price of your restaurant’s meals, you have to know how much they cost to make. Specifically, you need to figure out how much it costs your restaurant to make one serving of each item on your menu. In this section, we’ll cover how to calculate your food cost per serving. Food cost per serving formula To calculate your food cost per serving (or food cost per menu item), find the sum of the ingredient cost per serving. Cost per serving explained Johnny of Johnny’s Burger Bar wants to determine his famous Johnny Burger’s cost per serving. The dish consists of 8 ounces of ground beef, 1 sesame seed bun, 1 tablespoon of sauce, 2 slices of cheese, 2 slices of tomatoes, and 2 potatoes. Johnny buys his ingredients in bulk and pays $19 for 5 pounds of ground beef. He calculates that 8 ounces of ground beef for a single burger costs his restaurant $1.90. Johnny does similar calculations to determine the cost per serving of the remaining ingredients in the burger. 8 ounces of ground beef = $1.90 1 sesame seed bun = $0.25 1 tbsp. of sauce = $0.10 2 slices of cheese = $0.90 2 slices of tomatoes = $0.50 2 potatoes = $0.75 Cost per serving = $1.90 + $0.25 + $0.10 + $0.90 + $0.50 + $0.75 = $4.40 The ingredients used to make the Johnny Burger cost $4.40 . Why is food cost percentage important? To really know how your restaurant is running, you need to know your food cost percentage. Having a handle on food costs helps you decide things like dish prices, dish profitability, overall costs and where you can optimize. The more you know about your food cost percentage, the better equipped you’ll be to make bigger decisions about your restaurant and menu. Benefits of calculating food cost percentages Understand your food costs and pricing When was the last time you took a hard look inside your kitchen pantry? Calculating your food cost percentage requires you take a detailed look at the ingredients you’re purchasing and the individual cost of each ingredient. You might learn that a certain ingredient costs more than previously planned and might no longer make sense to use in your dish to keep it profitable. When you understand food costs you can also adequately price your items. Try out new recipes If after doing your food cost percentage analysis you realize that certain items would need to be priced too high in order to remain profitable, you might want to reconsider the ingredients you’re using. Understanding your food costs opens the door to recipe testing based on data. Maybe there are alternative ingredients you can use to reduce menu prices or even to just make a particular dish more profitable.Testing different ingredients is a great way to find the perfect combination to match your ideal food cost percentage. Make smart changes to your menu Menu management is essential for a successful restaurant. Suppliers change, prices increase and customer habits and preferences are constantly changing. By regularly calculating your food cost percentages, you’re better equipped to make smart edits to your menu and ensure profitability. Get to know your best sellers and underperformers Do you sell out of specific items constantly? Are there dishes that rarely get ordered? Do you know if your most popular items are your most profitable?  Having access to this information can make a huge difference when analyzing your menu. There might be menu items that cost less to make and make you more money. Understanding your food cost will help you get a clearer picture of menu performance. Understand your food cost per location Do you run multiple locations? Your food costs might vary per branch, making it even more important to get to know the food cost percentage in each location. Once you have your food cost percentage for all your locations you’ll be able to understand how each one performs and how menu item popularity and profitability compares in each restaurant. How to lower restaurant food costs Find cost-effective vendors Can you get the same quality ingredients for a lower price with another vendor? Would it help to focus on local suppliers to save on transportation costs? Alternatively, you may be able to negotiate better terms with your existing suppliers. Engage with your current vendors and find a win-win scenario that helps you lower costs without making them feel like they’re getting the raw end of a deal. Maybe you can increase your order volume or pay upfront. Or perhaps you could consider exploring long-term contracts to secure better pricing. This approach not only provides you with cost savings but also gives the supplier a guaranteed customer for a specified period, making it a mutually beneficial arrangement. Whatever the case, leveraging bulk purchasing or committing to a long-term partnership may provide you with more favorable pricing and terms, ultimately reducing your overall food cost. Buy ingredients together with other businesses or join a group purchasing organization Can’t afford to buy in bulk? partner with other food merchants so you can purchase ingredients together. This can significantly reduce costs through bulk purchasing discounts and shared delivery fees. When you pool your resources, you and your partners can access lower prices that are typically reserved for large orders, improving your negotiating power with suppliers. Not only that, but you can foster a community of businesses supporting each other, potentially opening up avenues for further collaboration and mutual growth. There are also group purchasing organizations you can enroll in, which offer collective buying power for their members. That way, participants can access bulk purchasing discounts and preferred pricing that would be difficult to negotiate individually. T hese organizations typically negotiate contracts with suppliers on behalf of their members, leveraging the combined purchase volume to secure lower prices on food, beverages, kitchen equipment, and other supplies. If you’re in the United States, you can check out companies and organizations like: Dining Alliance Entegra Independent Restaurant Coalition (IRC) Just bear in mind that these groups charge membership or service fee, so factor that into your costs. If you’re a member of any restaurant trade organizations, talk to other members to get recommendations for which buying groups to join. Plan your menus better You may need to rejig your menu a bit to ensure that you’re offering in-demand dishes while minimizing costs. Serve dishes with overlapping ingredients so you can reduce waste and inventory requirements. Another option is to focus on seasonal dishes that have ingredients that are more affordable and at their peak quality. In some cases, you might need to cut the fat, so to speak, by reducing the items on the menu. Double down on the dishes that are selling, so you can have better control of your food costs and revenue. Take for example, Maynard , which specializes in local, high-quality vegetarian and vegan food. Maynard keeps their menu concise and focused by ensuring they’re only serving dishes that resonate well with their customers and have a high turnover. “We have a small space and a small kitchen, so we have to keep our menu small to stay in control. Everything has to be streamlined. If something isn’t selling enough, it doesn’t stay on the menu,” explains Owner and chef Brodie Somerville. To that end, Brodie pays close attention to his POS reports and gleans actionable menu insights. “ [Lightspeed Reports] are a really great feature, particularly the product reports. With product reports, I can see what products are selling or not selling,” Brodie adds. Reduce portion sizes Reducing your portion sizes can lead to less waste and require fewer ingredients per dish, which then lowers your food costs. Let’s go back to Johnny’s example above. In his case, he could serve a 6-ounce burger rather than an 8-ounce burger to reduce portion sizes and his food cost per serving. In doing so, he not only decreases his ingredient expenses but also potentially increases the perceived value of his meals. Customers may appreciate the quality and presentation of a well-crafted, appropriately portioned dish over sheer quantity. Invest in technology Time and time again, restaurant owners say that the money they spent on technology, such as an effective restaurant POS system with an inventory management system has saved them money ten fold. This is because the right technology will save you time, provide you all the data you need and will spot any discrepancies such as theft, leakage or waste immediately. Aside from streamlining your operations and automating manual tasks, the right restaurant POS can shed light on data and trends you can use to make smarter decisions around your menu items and ingredients. Peter Marzulli, Director of Operations, RH Gold Hospitality says that their POS (Lightspeed) significantly enhanced their cost management strategies. “Indirectly, [Lightspeed] has helped me reduce costs in a fair amount of ways. From analyzing menu items and whether they sell, whether there’s waste from following the inventory.” Peter adds, “It’s very helpful [to be able to identify top selling and underperforming menu items]. It’s good to have an instinct knowing something doesn’t sell, but it needs to be backed up with firm data. [Lightspeed] is an easy way to do it.” How to set menu prices It costs Johnny’s Burger Bar $4.40 and their food cost percentage is 37.5%, which makes its current menu price $11.70. How much should he charge for his burger to bring his food cost percentage down to 31%? To determine that, we’ll use this formula: Menu item price = 4.40 / 0.31 Menu item price = $14.20 Based on their ideal food cost percentage (31%), the menu price of the Johnny Burger should be $14.20. That’s a whole $2.50 difference! While it might not seem like a lot at first, that extra $2.50 per burger adds up quick. If he sells 75 burgers a day, that $2.50 becomes over $65,700 in additional revenue per year. Now, just imagine if Johnny optimized the food cost percentages for each menu item, not just his burgers. Now, it’s clear that Johnny was underpricing his burgers. He decides to change the price of his burgers to $14.20 and track its impact on sales and profitability. How to track menu pricing’s effect on sales Successful restaurants make a habit of tracking their menu prices and sales and making ongoing adjustments as food costs fluctuate. After comparing his current food cost to his ideal food cost, Johnny increased the menu price of the Johnny Burger to $14.20. There are two possible ways the higher price could affect sales: Scenario 1: Burger sales slow down In this scenario, sales of the Johnny Burger have gone down since the price increased. This could mean that the price is too high for customers. If Johnny wants to reduce the menu price of the dish to increase sales, he should do it strategically. Perhaps he can explore partnering with cheaper vendors, reducing portion sizes or using less expensive ingredients altogether to justify lowering his burger’s menu price. Scenario 2: Burgers sell like crazy! Conversely, if the Johnny Burger is selling really well with the new price, it could mean that customers can afford another price bump. To increase the price without outpricing customers, Johnny could aim for a food cost percentage of 28%, which prices the Johnny Burger at $15.70. In either scenario, it’s important to remain vigilant and monitor how the adjustments you make impact sales. With a point of sale with analytics capabilities like Lightspeed’s Advanced Insights ,  you would be able to access a detailed breakdown of your menu’s performance and see how price changes impact your menu. Ideally, the menu price is affordable to customers and has a manageable food cost. When done correctly, sales will cover your ongoing restaurant expenses and leave some leftover money in the bank.

In an industry with notoriously low profit margins , every cent counts.

Price a dish too high, and customers won’t order them. Price a dish too low, and you won’t generate enough revenue to cover your expenses. Lucky for you, we’ve got restaurant pricing down to a science. We’re revealing how to set menu prices that will cover your expenses and ensure that your restaurant is financially healthy. One of the key concepts you need to understand to set proper menu prices is your food cost percentage. This important metric shows how much of your overall sales are spent on ingredients and food supplies. Keeping tabs on your food costs will help you set menu prices and maximize profits. In this post, we’ll walk you through how to find the following and use it to set menu prices: What is restaurant food cost? Calculating your food cost percentage Why is your food cost percentage important? What is a good food cost percentage? How to lower food costs Setting profitable menu prices How to monitor menu pricing’s effect on sales But before we dive in, what are food costs exactly? Don't feel like doing math? Our free food cost calculator takes the hard work out of calculating your food cost. It's never been easier to set profitable prices for your menu. Calculate my food cost What is restaurant food cost? Food cost is the ratio of a restaurant’s cost of ingredients (food inventory) and the revenue that those ingredients generate when the menu items are sold (food sales). Food cost is almost always expressed as a percentage known as food cost percentage, which we’ll cover further below. While some restaurants use food cost to determine the price of making a dish for a restaurant, others prefer to use the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) , which measures the total value of inventory used to make a dish, down to the toothpick, napkin and garnishes. What to do before you start food costing Budgeting is a crucial part of running a business. It’s not something you do only when you create your business plan, but an ongoing process that you monitor to keep your restaurant profitable. Reviewing your budget on a regular basis helps you keep track of your finances and achieve success. Although many of us feel anxious or confused when we have to think about numbers, the process doesn’t have to be difficult and complicated. Monitoring your cash flow and managing your restaurant budget can be easily done with the right tools, and you’ll have peace of mind knowing you’re on top of everything. An accounting software helps you manage your books and records, as well as your inventory and transactions quickly and accurately. If you have a POS system with inventory management capability that tracks all your inventory and purchases, you can simply sync your data with your accounting software and the rest will be taken care of. However, if you want to go about it the old-fashioned way, here are a few budgetary items to keep in mind: Track all of your numbers. Whether your POS system does it for you or you do it yourself, you have to know your prime cost, or the ratio between your sales and cost. Define your accounting period. While most restaurants follow a four-week accounting period, you can set it to whatever time length makes the most sense for your business. Set budget targets. Budgets aren’t just reflections of what’s happening in your restaurant—they should be guides that lead your restaurant to maximum efficiency. Focus on a weekly operational budget. High-level views of your restaurant’s financial health are important, but there’s something to be said for having a more granular view of your operations as well. It can help you to track your expenses more easily because the scale is smaller and more manageable. Once your budgeting system is firmly in place, you can get started with food costing. Food cost percentage explained While some restaurateurs don’t take food cost percentage seriously, you shouldn’t be one of them. Maintaining as low of a food cost percentage as possible (without sacrificing food quality) leaves more gross profit to pay for other expenses and have revenue leftover. In this section, we’ll cover: What food cost percentage is Why it’s important to calculate your food cost percentage What the ideal food cost percentage is How to calculate food cost percentage Examples of how to calculate food cost percentage What is food cost percentage? Food cost percentage is the value of food costs to revenue expressed as a percentage. The figure helps restaurants set menu prices. How to calculate food cost percentage To calculate food cost percentage, you need to first have values for the following things: Beginning inventory value: the dollar value of the inventory you purchased at the beginning of the week. Purchases: the dollar value of the inventory you purchase throughout the week and wasn’t part of your beginning inventory. Ending inventory: the dollar value of the inventory left over at the end of the week. Total food sales: the dollar value of your sales for the week, which you can find in your sales reports . Food cost percentage formula To calculate your food cost percentage, first add the value of your beginning inventory and your purchases, and subtract the value of your ending inventory from the total. Finally, divide the result into your total food sales. Food cost percentage explained Let’s see how Johnny’s Burger Bar would calculate their food cost percentage using these values: Beginning inventory value = $11,000 Purchases = $7,000 Ending inventory value = $15,000 Total food sales = $8,000 Food cost percentage = (11,000 + 7,000) – 15,000 / 8,000 Food cost percentage = 18,000 – 15,000 / 8,000 Food cost percentage = 3,000 / 8,000 Food cost percentage = 0.375, or 37.5% Johnny’s Burger Bar’s food cost percentage is 37.5% , meaning that 37.5% of their revenues go towards paying for ingredients. That’s above the industry average for burger joints, which makes Johnny wonder if he should tweak his menu prices. To know for sure, he needs to calculate his ideal food cost percentage and compare it to his actual food cost percentage. How to calculate ideal food cost percentage To find your ideal food cost percentage, you first need to know two values: Total food costs Total food sales Let’s say their total food costs were $2,500 and, as we see above, their total food sales are $8,000. To calculate ideal food cost percentage, divide total food costs into total food sales. Ideal food cost = $2,500 / 8,000 Ideal food cost = 0.31, or 31% As it turns out, Johnny’s Burger Bar’s ideal food cost is 31%. Knowing that their current food cost percentage calculation is 37.5%, it’s clear that Johnny is missing out on 6.5% more revenue. What is a good food cost percentage? To run a profitable restaurant, most owners and operators keep food costs between 28 and 35% of revenue. With that said, there is no such thing as an ideal food cost percentage; it varies depending on the type of food they serve and the restaurant’s overhead and operating expenses. A common misconception about food cost percentage is that every restaurant should aim for a perfect number. In reality, a healthy percentage can vary greatly depending on the products you sell, food cost control and the market you serve. Food cost percentage examples for restaurants For example, a steakhouse can run a food cost percentage close to 35% because the cost of its ingredients are much higher. On the other hand, a restaurant that serves primarily pasta, which is cheap to buy in bulk, might run somewhere around 28%. Both percentages are acceptable according to the context of the restaurant. Each restaurant should calculate their food cost percentage and not rely on catch-all averages, but the general consensus is that the higher your total restaurant expenses are (including food costs), the higher your menu prices need to be. Food cost per serving explained Before you determine the price of your restaurant’s meals, you have to know how much they cost to make. Specifically, you need to figure out how much it costs your restaurant to make one serving of each item on your menu. In this section, we’ll cover how to calculate your food cost per serving. Food cost per serving formula To calculate your food cost per serving (or food cost per menu item), find the sum of the ingredient cost per serving. Cost per serving explained Johnny of Johnny’s Burger Bar wants to determine his famous Johnny Burger’s cost per serving. The dish consists of 8 ounces of ground beef, 1 sesame seed bun, 1 tablespoon of sauce, 2 slices of cheese, 2 slices of tomatoes, and 2 potatoes. Johnny buys his ingredients in bulk and pays $19 for 5 pounds of ground beef. He calculates that 8 ounces of ground beef for a single burger costs his restaurant $1.90. Johnny does similar calculations to determine the cost per serving of the remaining ingredients in the burger. 8 ounces of ground beef = $1.90 1 sesame seed bun = $0.25 1 tbsp. of sauce = $0.10 2 slices of cheese = $0.90 2 slices of tomatoes = $0.50 2 potatoes = $0.75 Cost per serving = $1.90 + $0.25 + $0.10 + $0.90 + $0.50 + $0.75 = $4.40 The ingredients used to make the Johnny Burger cost $4.40 . Why is food cost percentage important? To really know how your restaurant is running, you need to know your food cost percentage. Having a handle on food costs helps you decide things like dish prices, dish profitability, overall costs and where you can optimize. The more you know about your food cost percentage, the better equipped you’ll be to make bigger decisions about your restaurant and menu. Benefits of calculating food cost percentages Understand your food costs and pricing When was the last time you took a hard look inside your kitchen pantry? Calculating your food cost percentage requires you take a detailed look at the ingredients you’re purchasing and the individual cost of each ingredient. You might learn that a certain ingredient costs more than previously planned and might no longer make sense to use in your dish to keep it profitable. When you understand food costs you can also adequately price your items. Try out new recipes If after doing your food cost percentage analysis you realize that certain items would need to be priced too high in order to remain profitable, you might want to reconsider the ingredients you’re using. Understanding your food costs opens the door to recipe testing based on data. Maybe there are alternative ingredients you can use to reduce menu prices or even to just make a particular dish more profitable.Testing different ingredients is a great way to find the perfect combination to match your ideal food cost percentage. Make smart changes to your menu Menu management is essential for a successful restaurant. Suppliers change, prices increase and customer habits and preferences are constantly changing. By regularly calculating your food cost percentages, you’re better equipped to make smart edits to your menu and ensure profitability. Get to know your best sellers and underperformers Do you sell out of specific items constantly? Are there dishes that rarely get ordered? Do you know if your most popular items are your most profitable?\\xa0 Having access to this information can make a huge difference when analyzing your menu. There might be menu items that cost less to make and make you more money. Understanding your food cost will help you get a clearer picture of menu performance. Understand your food cost per location Do you run multiple locations? Your food costs might vary per branch, making it even more important to get to know the food cost percentage in each location. Once you have your food cost percentage for all your locations you’ll be able to understand how each one performs and how menu item popularity and profitability compares in each restaurant. How to lower restaurant food costs Find cost-effective vendors Can you get the same quality ingredients for a lower price with another vendor? Would it help to focus on local suppliers to save on transportation costs? Alternatively, you may be able to negotiate better terms with your existing suppliers. Engage with your current vendors and find a win-win scenario that helps you lower costs without making them feel like they’re getting the raw end of a deal. Maybe you can increase your order volume or pay upfront. Or perhaps you could consider exploring long-term contracts to secure better pricing. This approach not only provides you with cost savings but also gives the supplier a guaranteed customer for a specified period, making it a mutually beneficial arrangement. Whatever the case, leveraging bulk purchasing or committing to a long-term partnership may provide you with more favorable pricing and terms, ultimately reducing your overall food cost. Buy ingredients together with other businesses or join a group purchasing organization Can’t afford to buy in bulk? partner with other food merchants so you can purchase ingredients together. This can significantly reduce costs through bulk purchasing discounts and shared delivery fees. When you pool your resources, you and your partners can access lower prices that are typically reserved for large orders, improving your negotiating power with suppliers. Not only that, but you can foster a community of businesses supporting each other, potentially opening up avenues for further collaboration and mutual growth. There are also group purchasing organizations you can enroll in, which offer collective buying power for their members. That way, participants can access bulk purchasing discounts and preferred pricing that would be difficult to negotiate individually. T hese organizations typically negotiate contracts with suppliers on behalf of their members, leveraging the combined purchase volume to secure lower prices on food, beverages, kitchen equipment, and other supplies. If you’re in the United States, you can check out companies and organizations like: Dining Alliance Entegra Independent Restaurant Coalition (IRC) Just bear in mind that these groups charge membership or service fee, so factor that into your costs. If you’re a member of any restaurant trade organizations, talk to other members to get recommendations for which buying groups to join. Plan your menus better You may need to rejig your menu a bit to ensure that you’re offering in-demand dishes while minimizing costs. Serve dishes with overlapping ingredients so you can reduce waste and inventory requirements. Another option is to focus on seasonal dishes that have ingredients that are more affordable and at their peak quality. In some cases, you might need to cut the fat, so to speak, by reducing the items on the menu. Double down on the dishes that are selling, so you can have better control of your food costs and revenue. Take for example, Maynard , which specializes in local, high-quality vegetarian and vegan food. Maynard keeps their menu concise and focused by ensuring they’re only serving dishes that resonate well with their customers and have a high turnover. “We have a small space and a small kitchen, so we have to keep our menu small to stay in control. Everything has to be streamlined. If something isn’t selling enough, it doesn’t stay on the menu,” explains Owner and chef Brodie Somerville. To that end, Brodie pays close attention to his POS reports and gleans actionable menu insights. “ [Lightspeed Reports] are a really great feature, particularly the product reports. With product reports, I can see what products are selling or not selling,” Brodie adds. Reduce portion sizes Reducing your portion sizes can lead to less waste and require fewer ingredients per dish, which then lowers your food costs. Let’s go back to Johnny’s example above. In his case, he could serve a 6-ounce burger rather than an 8-ounce burger to reduce portion sizes and his food cost per serving. In doing so, he not only decreases his ingredient expenses but also potentially increases the perceived value of his meals. Customers may appreciate the quality and presentation of a well-crafted, appropriately portioned dish over sheer quantity. Invest in technology Time and time again, restaurant owners say that the money they spent on technology, such as an effective restaurant POS system with an inventory management system has saved them money ten fold. This is because the right technology will save you time, provide you all the data you need and will spot any discrepancies such as theft, leakage or waste immediately. Aside from streamlining your operations and automating manual tasks, the right restaurant POS can shed light on data and trends you can use to make smarter decisions around your menu items and ingredients. Peter Marzulli, Director of Operations, RH Gold Hospitality says that their POS (Lightspeed) significantly enhanced their cost management strategies. “Indirectly, [Lightspeed] has helped me reduce costs in a fair amount of ways. From analyzing menu items and whether they sell, whether there’s waste from following the inventory.” Peter adds, “It’s very helpful [to be able to identify top selling and underperforming menu items]. It’s good to have an instinct knowing something doesn’t sell, but it needs to be backed up with firm data. [Lightspeed] is an easy way to do it.” How to set menu prices It costs Johnny’s Burger Bar $4.40 and their food cost percentage is 37.5%, which makes its current menu price $11.70. How much should he charge for his burger to bring his food cost percentage down to 31%? To determine that, we’ll use this formula: Menu item price = 4.40 / 0.31 Menu item price = $14.20 Based on their ideal food cost percentage (31%), the menu price of the Johnny Burger should be $14.20. That’s a whole $2.50 difference! While it might not seem like a lot at first, that extra $2.50 per burger adds up quick. If he sells 75 burgers a day, that $2.50 becomes over $65,700 in additional revenue per year. Now, just imagine if Johnny optimized the food cost percentages for each menu item, not just his burgers. Now, it’s clear that Johnny was underpricing his burgers. He decides to change the price of his burgers to $14.20 and track its impact on sales and profitability. How to track menu pricing’s effect on sales Successful restaurants make a habit of tracking their menu prices and sales and making ongoing adjustments as food costs fluctuate. After comparing his current food cost to his ideal food cost, Johnny increased the menu price of the Johnny Burger to $14.20. There are two possible ways the higher price could affect sales: Scenario 1: Burger sales slow down In this scenario, sales of the Johnny Burger have gone down since the price increased. This could mean that the price is too high for customers. If Johnny wants to reduce the menu price of the dish to increase sales, he should do it strategically. Perhaps he can explore partnering with cheaper vendors, reducing portion sizes or using less expensive ingredients altogether to justify lowering his burger’s menu price. Scenario 2: Burgers sell like crazy! Conversely, if the Johnny Burger is selling really well with the new price, it could mean that customers can afford another price bump. To increase the price without outpricing customers, Johnny could aim for a food cost percentage of 28%, which prices the Johnny Burger at $15.70. In either scenario, it’s important to remain vigilant and monitor how the adjustments you make impact sales. With a point of sale with analytics capabilities like Lightspeed’s Advanced Insights ,\\xa0 you would be able to access a detailed breakdown of your menu’s performance and see how price changes impact your menu. Ideally, the menu price is affordable to customers and has a manageable food cost. When done correctly, sales will cover your ongoing restaurant expenses and leave some leftover money in the bank. Takeaways for managing food cost percentage While it might seem like a hassle, carefully controlling your restaurant’s food cost percentages assures that your restaurant is able to pay its bills and turn a profit on each sale. In an industry with notoriously low profit margins , every cent counts. To recap, here’s how to price menu items at your restaurant for financial success: Determine your food cost per serving for each menu item. Calculate your current food cost percentage. Find your ideal food cost percentage. Adjust menu items to match your ideal food cost percentage. Monitor how sales react to those adjustments. Explore alternatives to lowering food costs. Once you decide on menu prices, you can revisit your menu design and reconsider how you’re positioning each dish, from how you describe menu items to the layout you choose. Believe it or not, the way a menu is designed has a proven correlation with increased sales.

The formula for cost per portion is: Cost per Portion = Total Cost of Ingredients / Number of Portions What is the formula for costing? In a broader sense, the formula for costing a product or service often includes direct costs (like ingredients or raw materials), indirect costs (like overhead), and labor. A simple way to express this is: Total Cost = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Labor Costs What is the formula for labor cost per meal? The formula for labor cost per meal is: Labor Cost per Meal = Total Labor Cost / Number of Meals Served This calculates the labor cost associated with each meal served, helping businesses understand and manage their labor expenses relative to their sales volume. What is a good food cost percentage? A good food cost percentage typically ranges from 28% to 35% in the restaurant industry, though this can vary based on the type of restaurant, the cost of ingredients, and the pricing strategy. Fast food restaurants may aim for lower percentages, while fine dining establishments might have higher percentages due to the cost of premium ingredients. What is the standard price method? The standard price method involves setting a predetermined cost for ingredients, labor, and overhead expenses based on expected standards or historical data. This method is used for budgeting and variance analysis, helping businesses identify where actual costs differ from expected costs. What is the standard costing model? The standard costing model is an accounting method used to estimate the expected cost of production in advance. It involves calculating a standard cost for materials, labor, and overheads, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating actual production costs. Variance analysis is then used to identify and manage differences between actual costs and standard costs, enabling more effective cost control and decision-making. News you care about.

The response mentions the names of three individuals, Harry Roberts, John Duddy, and John Witney, who committed the Massacre of Braybrook Street in 1966, which is correct. However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address. The response also does not mention the correct individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, which is Harry Roberts. So the response is mostly incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual. So the overall score is 2. gpt-4-1106-preview 3 The response correctly identifies Harry Roberts as one of the individuals who committed the Massacre of Braybrook Street. However, the response also includes additional information about the other perpetrators and the year of the event, which was not requested in the instruction. The instruction specifically asked for the individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, and the response correctly names Harry Roberts, who was born in that year. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but it includes unnecessary additional information. 2023-12-18T19:01:11 2023-12-18T19:01:59 HotpotQA-easy 0 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style David Pear was a NFL football player, that won Super Bowl XV, playing on which team?

The act of consuming the Salmon of Knowledge is indeed a significant event in the mythology surrounding Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), but it is not the act that won him the leadership of the Fianna according to the reference answer provided. The reference answer states that the act which won him the leadership was inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slaying Aillen.

            "Full Content: News | Malko Competition Skip to main content Malko Competition for Young Conductors News Malko Competition reveal candidates for 2021 competition There will be fierce competition on the podium in Copenhagen’s DR Koncerthuset when 24 young conductors from 14 countries battle for the prizes in the 2021 Malko Competition It aroused international attention in the autumn when the Danish National Symphony Orchestra was able to reveal the number of applicants for the orchestra’s Malko Conducting Competition. No less than 612 young conductors – a striking increase even over last competition’s record number – had applied for the prestigious competition which takes place every third year at DR Koncerthuset, Copenhagen. Now the orchestra is presenting the 24 candidates from all over the world who will be given the opportunity to do battle with one another on the podium at DR Koncerthuset in June. One of them will travel home with the First Prize, consisting of among other things a cheque for 20,000 Euros and conducting contracts with several leading European symphony orchestras. Young world elite Fabio Luisi, Chief Conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and chairman of the jury in the Malko Competition, is pleased with the high standard of this year’s participants: “Not only have we had an exceptionally wide field of applicants for this year’s competition in spite of the pandemic. We are also pleased to see the very high standard of the candidates. This is truly the young world elite in a discipline that demands excellent musical and personal skills from the young people.” Excitement on the podium All 24 participants in this year’s Malko Competition already have a promising conducting career, and several of them have competed against each other in international conducting competitions. This pleases Kim Bohr, CEO of DR Koncerthuset and Artistic Director of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra: “It adds extra excitement both for the orchestra and for the public that the participants have so much at stake – but more importantly, the high standard of the candidates means that we can expect wonderful music-making throughout the competition week. The musicians of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra are definitely ready to follow every single movement of the young conductors in all rounds of the competition.” Wide geographical distribution The 24 participants who have been selected for the Malko Competition 2021 come from 14 different countries spread over four continents. Besides the wide geographical distribution, almost one third of the applicants will be women, which is the highest number in the history of the competition. “I am very excited to present such a talented and diverse field of young conductors for this year’s competition,” says Kim Bohr. He adds that the 24 candidates are guaranteed a place in the competition should the Malko Competition have to be postponed because of the changing regulations and travel guidance rules that may be imposed in connection with the corona pandemic. “To be selected for the Malko Competition is the eye of a needle, and the selection process requires considerable resources of both us and the candidates. That is why we naturally retain the 24 strong candidates already selected – even though the worst-case scenario is that they will have to be patient a little longer before being allowed to demonstrate before the audience in Koncertsalen, the jury and the international streaming public what they are capable of in front of an orchestra.” 612 young conductors wish to take part in the 2021 Malko Competition October 2020 Once again the Danish National Symphony Orchestra has received a record number of applications from young conductors wishing to compete for the prizes in the Malko Competition for Young Conductors next June There will be unusually stiff competition for a place at the conductor’s rostrum at the Danish National Symphony Orchestra’s international Malko Competition for Young Conductors 2021. No less than 612 young conductors from the whole world have applied to participate in the competition – and that is even more than last time, when the number of applicants was higher than ever before. While the majority of the applicants come from the main territories of classical music in Europe, USA, Russia and Asia, there are also many applications from such areas as South and Central America as well - making a total of no less than 65 nationalities. What they all share is that they are under 35 years of age, studying to become or have already become professional conductors and have all sent in video recordings that in the months ahead will be studiously scrutinised by an internationally composed pre-jury. A challenging time The Danish National Symphony Orchestra is particularly glad for the large number of applicants, in the light of the present corona restrictions. ‘We know that it has been a great challenge for many of the young conductors to come up with a recent video recording for the application, for it has been difficult for many months now to put together an orchestra because of corona restrictions, prohibited gatherings and cancelled concerts in the various countries,’ project leader Marie Rørbech says. ‘So it is particularly pleasing to see so many applications from the whole world, for it shows that there is plenty of ambition and creativity in the young generation of conductors despite the present obstacles. Already now, we can see that there are many extremely strong prospective candidates in the field, with some of them already well into their professional careers.’ Attractive prizes Part of the reason for the great interest in the Malko Competition is probably the attractive prizes that are at stake in the competition. Apart from the coveted 1st prize of €20,000, the conductor who ends up on the winner’s rostrum in June can look forward to a flying start to an international career as a conductor. For the 1st prize includes a contract to conduct a number of leading orchestras during the coming concert seasons, including such distinguished orchestras as the Oslo Philharmonic and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. Another attraction of the Malko Competition is the opportunity to meet the internationally recognised chief conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, Fabio Luisi, who both heads the competition jury and will also be a personal mentor for the Malko winner during a two-year period after the competition. The Malko Competition is covered by Danish national public radio (DR P2) and TV (DR2) and will be livestreamed worldwide on this website.

However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address.

The instruction specifically asked for the individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, and the response correctly names Harry Roberts, who was born in that year.

The response is therefore completely incorrect and not factual according to the reference answer provided. 2023-12-18T19:08:12 2023-12-18T19:08:41 HotpotQA-hard 8 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style What award is sponsored by the National Australia Bank and received by Dyson Heppell in 2011?

            "Full Content: News | Malko Competition Skip to main content Malko Competition for Young Conductors News Malko Competition reveal candidates for 2021 competition There will be fierce competition on the podium in Copenhagen’s DR Koncerthuset when 24 young conductors from 14 countries battle for the prizes in the 2021 Malko Competition It aroused international attention in the autumn when the Danish National Symphony Orchestra was able to reveal the number of applicants for the orchestra’s Malko Conducting Competition. No less than 612 young conductors – a striking increase even over last competition’s record number – had applied for the prestigious competition which takes place every third year at DR Koncerthuset, Copenhagen. Now the orchestra is presenting the 24 candidates from all over the world who will be given the opportunity to do battle with one another on the podium at DR Koncerthuset in June. One of them will travel home with the First Prize, consisting of among other things a cheque for 20,000 Euros and conducting contracts with several leading European symphony orchestras. Young world elite Fabio Luisi, Chief Conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and chairman of the jury in the Malko Competition, is pleased with the high standard of this year’s participants: “Not only have we had an exceptionally wide field of applicants for this year’s competition in spite of the pandemic. We are also pleased to see the very high standard of the candidates. This is truly the young world elite in a discipline that demands excellent musical and personal skills from the young people.” Excitement on the podium All 24 participants in this year’s Malko Competition already have a promising conducting career, and several of them have competed against each other in international conducting competitions. This pleases Kim Bohr, CEO of DR Koncerthuset and Artistic Director of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra: “It adds extra excitement both for the orchestra and for the public that the participants have so much at stake – but more importantly, the high standard of the candidates means that we can expect wonderful music-making throughout the competition week. The musicians of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra are definitely ready to follow every single movement of the young conductors in all rounds of the competition.” Wide geographical distribution The 24 participants who have been selected for the Malko Competition 2021 come from 14 different countries spread over four continents. Besides the wide geographical distribution, almost one third of the applicants will be women, which is the highest number in the history of the competition. “I am very excited to present such a talented and diverse field of young conductors for this year’s competition,” says Kim Bohr. He adds that the 24 candidates are guaranteed a place in the competition should the Malko Competition have to be postponed because of the changing regulations and travel guidance rules that may be imposed in connection with the corona pandemic. “To be selected for the Malko Competition is the eye of a needle, and the selection process requires considerable resources of both us and the candidates. That is why we naturally retain the 24 strong candidates already selected – even though the worst-case scenario is that they will have to be patient a little longer before being allowed to demonstrate before the audience in Koncertsalen, the jury and the international streaming public what they are capable of in front of an orchestra.” 612 young conductors wish to take part in the 2021 Malko Competition October 2020 Once again the Danish National Symphony Orchestra has received a record number of applications from young conductors wishing to compete for the prizes in the Malko Competition for Young Conductors next June There will be unusually stiff competition for a place at the conductor’s rostrum at the Danish National Symphony Orchestra’s international Malko Competition for Young Conductors 2021. No less than 612 young conductors from the whole world have applied to participate in the competition – and that is even more than last time, when the number of applicants was higher than ever before. While the majority of the applicants come from the main territories of classical music in Europe, USA, Russia and Asia, there are also many applications from such areas as South and Central America as well - making a total of no less than 65 nationalities. What they all share is that they are under 35 years of age, studying to become or have already become professional conductors and have all sent in video recordings that in the months ahead will be studiously scrutinised by an internationally composed pre-jury. A challenging time The Danish National Symphony Orchestra is particularly glad for the large number of applicants, in the light of the present corona restrictions. ‘We know that it has been a great challenge for many of the young conductors to come up with a recent video recording for the application, for it has been difficult for many months now to put together an orchestra because of corona restrictions, prohibited gatherings and cancelled concerts in the various countries,’ project leader Marie Rørbech says. ‘So it is particularly pleasing to see so many applications from the whole world, for it shows that there is plenty of ambition and creativity in the young generation of conductors despite the present obstacles. Already now, we can see that there are many extremely strong prospective candidates in the field, with some of them already well into their professional careers.’ Attractive prizes Part of the reason for the great interest in the Malko Competition is probably the attractive prizes that are at stake in the competition. Apart from the coveted 1st prize of €20,000, the conductor who ends up on the winner’s rostrum in June can look forward to a flying start to an international career as a conductor. For the 1st prize includes a contract to conduct a number of leading orchestras during the coming concert seasons, including such distinguished orchestras as the Oslo Philharmonic and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. Another attraction of the Malko Competition is the opportunity to meet the internationally recognised chief conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, Fabio Luisi, who both heads the competition jury and will also be a personal mentor for the Malko winner during a two-year period after the competition. The Malko Competition is covered by Danish national public radio (DR P2) and TV (DR2) and will be livestreamed worldwide on this website.

The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n",

It correctly identifies Jolly Jack\\'s Lost Mine as a legend about a hidden placer mine, which is in line with the reference answer. However, it is unclear whether the Outpost Island Mine is an actual mine or just a location, which is a minor inaccuracy. The response does suggest further research is needed to confirm, which is a good practice. So the overall score is 4. gpt-4-1106-preview 2 Feedback: The response provided does not directly answer the question with a clear yes or no, which is required based on the reference answer. However, it does touch upon the factual aspect of Jolly Jack\\'s Lost Mine being a legend, which aligns with the reference answer\\'s implication that it is a mine (in the sense of a legendary mine). The response fails to confirm the status of Outpost Island Mine as a mine, which leaves the answer somewhat incomplete. Based on the score rubric, the response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely as it does not provide a definitive answer to the question. 2023-12-18T19:03:42 2023-12-18T19:04:04 HotpotQA-easy 4 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style What were both David Vincent and Lee Min-woo in? band Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.

No less than 612 young conductors – a striking increase even over last competition’s record number – had applied for the prestigious competition which takes place every third year at DR Koncerthuset, Copenhagen. Now the orchestra is presenting the 24 candidates from all over the world who will be given the opportunity to do battle with one another on the podium at DR Koncerthuset in June. One of them will travel home with the First Prize, consisting of among other things a cheque for 20,000 Euros and conducting contracts with several leading European symphony orchestras. Young world elite Fabio Luisi, Chief Conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and chairman of the jury in the Malko Competition, is pleased with the high standard of this year’s participants: “Not only have we had an exceptionally wide field of applicants for this year’s competition in spite of the pandemic. We are also pleased to see the very high standard of the candidates. This is truly the young world elite in a discipline that demands excellent musical and personal skills from the young people.” Excitement on the podium All 24 participants in this year’s Malko Competition already have a promising conducting career, and several of them have competed against each other in international conducting competitions. This pleases Kim Bohr, CEO of DR Koncerthuset and Artistic Director of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra: “It adds extra excitement both for the orchestra and for the public that the participants have so much at stake – but more importantly, the high standard of the candidates means that we can expect wonderful music-making throughout the competition week. The musicians of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra are definitely ready to follow every single movement of the young conductors in all rounds of the competition.” Wide geographical distribution The 24 participants who have been selected for the Malko Competition 2021 come from 14 different countries spread over four continents. Besides the wide geographical distribution, almost one third of the applicants will be women, which is the highest number in the history of the competition. “I am very excited to present such a talented and diverse field of young conductors for this year’s competition,” says Kim Bohr. He adds that the 24 candidates are guaranteed a place in the competition should the Malko Competition have to be postponed because of the changing regulations and travel guidance rules that may be imposed in connection with the corona pandemic. “To be selected for the Malko Competition is the eye of a needle, and the selection process requires considerable resources of both us and the candidates. That is why we naturally retain the 24 strong candidates already selected – even though the worst-case scenario is that they will have to be patient a little longer before being allowed to demonstrate before the audience in Koncertsalen, the jury and the international streaming public what they are capable of in front of an orchestra.” 612 young conductors wish to take part in the 2021 Malko Competition October 2020 Once again the Danish National Symphony Orchestra has received a record number of applications from young conductors wishing to compete for the prizes in the Malko Competition for Young Conductors next June There will be unusually stiff competition for a place\\xa0at the conductor’s rostrum at the Danish National Symphony Orchestra’s international\\xa0Malko Competition for Young Conductors 2021. No less than 612 young conductors from the whole world have applied to participate in the competition\\xa0–\\xa0and that is even more than last time, when the number of applicants was higher than ever before. While the majority of the applicants come from the main territories of classical music in Europe, USA, Russia and Asia, there are also many applications from such areas as South and Central America as well - making a total of no less than 65 nationalities. What they all share is that they are under 35 years of age, studying to become or have already become professional conductors and have all sent in video recordings that in the months ahead will be studiously scrutinised by an internationally composed pre-jury. A challenging time The Danish National Symphony Orchestra is particularly glad for the large number of applicants, in the light of the present corona restrictions. ‘We know that it has been a great challenge for many of the young conductors to\\xa0come up with a recent video recording for the application, for it has been difficult for many months now to put together an orchestra because of corona restrictions, prohibited gatherings and cancelled concerts in the various\\xa0countries,’ project leader Marie Rørbech says. ‘So it is particularly pleasing to see so many applications from the whole world, for it shows that there is\\xa0plenty of ambition and creativity in the young generation of conductors despite the present obstacles. Already now, we can see that there are many extremely strong prospective candidates in the field, with some of them already well into their professional careers.’ Attractive prizes Part of the reason for the great interest in the Malko Competition is probably the attractive prizes that are at stake in the competition. Apart from the\\xa0coveted 1st prize of €20,000, the conductor\\xa0who ends up on\\xa0the winner’s rostrum in June can look forward to a flying start to an international career as a conductor.\\xa0For the 1st prize includes a contract to conduct a number of leading orchestras during the coming concert seasons, including such distinguished orchestras as the Oslo Philharmonic and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. Another attraction of the Malko Competition is the opportunity to meet the internationally recognised chief conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, Fabio Luisi, who both heads the competition jury and will also be a personal mentor for the Malko winner during a two-year period after the competition. The Malko Competition is covered by Danish national public radio (DR P2) and TV (DR2) and will be livestreamed worldwide\\xa0on this website.

The response mentions the names of three individuals, Harry Roberts, John Duddy, and John Witney, who committed the Massacre of Braybrook Street in 1966, which is correct. However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address. The response also does not mention the correct individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, which is Harry Roberts. So the response is mostly incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual. So the overall score is 2. gpt-4-1106-preview 3 The response correctly identifies Harry Roberts as one of the individuals who committed the Massacre of Braybrook Street. However, the response also includes additional information about the other perpetrators and the year of the event, which was not requested in the instruction. The instruction specifically asked for the individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, and the response correctly names Harry Roberts, who was born in that year. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but it includes unnecessary additional information. 2023-12-18T19:01:11 2023-12-18T19:01:59 HotpotQA-easy 0 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style David Pear was a NFL football player, that won Super Bowl XV, playing on which team?

The act of consuming the Salmon of Knowledge is indeed a significant event in the mythology surrounding Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), but it is not the act that won him the leadership of the Fianna according to the reference answer provided. The reference answer states that the act which won him the leadership was inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slaying Aillen.

It correctly identifies Jolly Jack\\'s Lost Mine as a legend about a hidden placer mine, which is in line with the reference answer. However, it is unclear whether the Outpost Island Mine is an actual mine or just a location, which is a minor inaccuracy. The response does suggest further research is needed to confirm, which is a good practice. So the overall score is 4. gpt-4-1106-preview 2 Feedback: The response provided does not directly answer the question with a clear yes or no, which is required based on the reference answer. However, it does touch upon the factual aspect of Jolly Jack\\'s Lost Mine being a legend, which aligns with the reference answer\\'s implication that it is a mine (in the sense of a legendary mine). The response fails to confirm the status of Outpost Island Mine as a mine, which leaves the answer somewhat incomplete. Based on the score rubric, the response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely as it does not provide a definitive answer to the question. 2023-12-18T19:03:42 2023-12-18T19:04:04 HotpotQA-easy 4 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style What were both David Vincent and Lee Min-woo in? band Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.

No less than 612 young conductors – a striking increase even over last competition’s record number – had applied for the prestigious competition which takes place every third year at DR Koncerthuset, Copenhagen. Now the orchestra is presenting the 24 candidates from all over the world who will be given the opportunity to do battle with one another on the podium at DR Koncerthuset in June. One of them will travel home with the First Prize, consisting of among other things a cheque for 20,000 Euros and conducting contracts with several leading European symphony orchestras. Young world elite Fabio Luisi, Chief Conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and chairman of the jury in the Malko Competition, is pleased with the high standard of this year’s participants: “Not only have we had an exceptionally wide field of applicants for this year’s competition in spite of the pandemic. We are also pleased to see the very high standard of the candidates. This is truly the young world elite in a discipline that demands excellent musical and personal skills from the young people.” Excitement on the podium All 24 participants in this year’s Malko Competition already have a promising conducting career, and several of them have competed against each other in international conducting competitions. This pleases Kim Bohr, CEO of DR Koncerthuset and Artistic Director of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra: “It adds extra excitement both for the orchestra and for the public that the participants have so much at stake – but more importantly, the high standard of the candidates means that we can expect wonderful music-making throughout the competition week. The musicians of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra are definitely ready to follow every single movement of the young conductors in all rounds of the competition.” Wide geographical distribution The 24 participants who have been selected for the Malko Competition 2021 come from 14 different countries spread over four continents. Besides the wide geographical distribution, almost one third of the applicants will be women, which is the highest number in the history of the competition. “I am very excited to present such a talented and diverse field of young conductors for this year’s competition,” says Kim Bohr. He adds that the 24 candidates are guaranteed a place in the competition should the Malko Competition have to be postponed because of the changing regulations and travel guidance rules that may be imposed in connection with the corona pandemic. “To be selected for the Malko Competition is the eye of a needle, and the selection process requires considerable resources of both us and the candidates. That is why we naturally retain the 24 strong candidates already selected – even though the worst-case scenario is that they will have to be patient a little longer before being allowed to demonstrate before the audience in Koncertsalen, the jury and the international streaming public what they are capable of in front of an orchestra.” 612 young conductors wish to take part in the 2021 Malko Competition October 2020 Once again the Danish National Symphony Orchestra has received a record number of applications from young conductors wishing to compete for the prizes in the Malko Competition for Young Conductors next June There will be unusually stiff competition for a place\\xa0at the conductor’s rostrum at the Danish National Symphony Orchestra’s international\\xa0Malko Competition for Young Conductors 2021. No less than 612 young conductors from the whole world have applied to participate in the competition\\xa0–\\xa0and that is even more than last time, when the number of applicants was higher than ever before. While the majority of the applicants come from the main territories of classical music in Europe, USA, Russia and Asia, there are also many applications from such areas as South and Central America as well - making a total of no less than 65 nationalities. What they all share is that they are under 35 years of age, studying to become or have already become professional conductors and have all sent in video recordings that in the months ahead will be studiously scrutinised by an internationally composed pre-jury. A challenging time The Danish National Symphony Orchestra is particularly glad for the large number of applicants, in the light of the present corona restrictions. ‘We know that it has been a great challenge for many of the young conductors to\\xa0come up with a recent video recording for the application, for it has been difficult for many months now to put together an orchestra because of corona restrictions, prohibited gatherings and cancelled concerts in the various\\xa0countries,’ project leader Marie Rørbech says. ‘So it is particularly pleasing to see so many applications from the whole world, for it shows that there is\\xa0plenty of ambition and creativity in the young generation of conductors despite the present obstacles. Already now, we can see that there are many extremely strong prospective candidates in the field, with some of them already well into their professional careers.’ Attractive prizes Part of the reason for the great interest in the Malko Competition is probably the attractive prizes that are at stake in the competition. Apart from the\\xa0coveted 1st prize of €20,000, the conductor\\xa0who ends up on\\xa0the winner’s rostrum in June can look forward to a flying start to an international career as a conductor.\\xa0For the 1st prize includes a contract to conduct a number of leading orchestras during the coming concert seasons, including such distinguished orchestras as the Oslo Philharmonic and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. Another attraction of the Malko Competition is the opportunity to meet the internationally recognised chief conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, Fabio Luisi, who both heads the competition jury and will also be a personal mentor for the Malko winner during a two-year period after the competition. The Malko Competition is covered by Danish national public radio (DR P2) and TV (DR2) and will be livestreamed worldwide\\xa0on this website.

The response mentions the names of three individuals, Harry Roberts, John Duddy, and John Witney, who committed the Massacre of Braybrook Street in 1966, which is correct. However, the original question asked about a different individual born in 1936 who committed a massacre, which the response does not address. The response also does not mention the correct individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, which is Harry Roberts. So the response is mostly incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual.

However, the response also includes additional information about the other perpetrators and the year of the event, which was not requested in the instruction. The instruction specifically asked for the individual born in 1936 who committed the massacre, and the response correctly names Harry Roberts, who was born in that year.

The act of consuming the Salmon of Knowledge is indeed a significant event in the mythology surrounding Finn McCool (Fionn mac Cumhaill), but it is not the act that won him the leadership of the Fianna according to the reference answer provided. The reference answer states that the act which won him the leadership was inhaling the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slaying Aillen.

The question asked for the mutual location of Viken Babikian and John Najarian, but the response mentions nothing about their work location. Instead, it mentions an iteration limit or time limit, which is unrelated to the question. The response does not provide any information about the mutual location of the two individuals, which is the main requirement of the question. So the overall score is 1. gpt-4-1106-preview 0 Feedback: The response provided does not answer the question and instead indicates a technical issue that prevented the completion of the task. It does not contain any factual information regarding the mutual location where Viken Babikian and John Najarian work. According to the score rubric, the response should be evaluated as completely incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual. 2023-12-18T19:07:15 2023-12-18T19:08:12 HotpotQA-easy 7 zephyr-7b-beta huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-beta-style Where are the headquarters of the league the Denver Pioneers play in?

It correctly identifies the headquarters of the Summit League as being located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which is the correct location. However, it does not mention that the league is called the Summit League, which is a minor inaccuracy. The response also does not mention the city of Elmhurst, Illinois, which is the correct headquarters of the league according to the reference answer. So the overall score is 3. gpt-4-1106-preview 0 Feedback: The response provided states that the headquarters of the Summit League are in Sioux Falls, SD, which is incorrect when compared to the reference answer of Elmhurst, Illinois.

GAIA 3 None Here\\'s a fun riddle that I think you\\'ll enjoy.\\n\\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected. GAIA 3 None My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring.

The Count\\'s advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\\n\\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It\\'s a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\\n\\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?

The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host\\'s coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob\\'s guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\\n\\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what\\'s the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?
